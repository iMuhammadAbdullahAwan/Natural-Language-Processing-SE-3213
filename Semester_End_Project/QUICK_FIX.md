## ðŸŽ¨ Optional: Add Custom Icons Later

If you want custom icons, you have several options:

### Option 1: Use Online Icon Generator
1. Go to any online PNG icon generator
2. Create 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, and 128x128 pixel icons
3. Save them as `icon16.png`, `icon32.png`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.png`
4. Put them in the `icons/` folder
5. Update `manifest.json` to include icon references

### Option 2: Use the Provided Scripts
- Run `create_icons.py` if you have Python installed
- Or open `generate_icons.html` in a web browser to download icons

### Option 3: Simple Text-Based Icons
Create simple 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, and 128x128 pixel images with any image editor and save them in the `icons/` folder.
