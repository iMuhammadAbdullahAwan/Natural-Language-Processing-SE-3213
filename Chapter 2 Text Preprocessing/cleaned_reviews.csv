"One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you'll be hooked. They are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. Its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.<br /><br />It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.<br /><br />I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.",one of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 oz episode you'll be hooked they are right as this is exactly what happened with me<br /><br />the first thing that struck me about oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence which set in right from the word go trust me this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid this show pulls no punches with regards to drugs sex or violence its is hardcore in the classic use of the word<br /><br />it is called oz as that is the nickname given to the oswald maximum security state penitentary it focuses mainly on emerald city an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards so privacy is not high on the agenda em city is home to manyaryans muslims gangstas latinos christians italians irish and moreso scuffles death stares dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away<br /><br />i would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences forget charm forget romanceoz doesn't mess around the first episode i ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal i couldn't say i was ready for it but as i watched more i developed a taste for oz and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence not just violence but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it well mannered middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) watching oz you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewingthats if you can get in touch with your darker side,"['reviewers', 'mentioned', 'watching', 'oz', 'episode', 'hooked', 'right', 'exactly', 'happened', 'br', 'thing', 'struck', 'oz', 'brutality', 'unflinching', 'scenes', 'violence', 'set', 'right', 'word', 'trust', 'faint', 'hearted', 'timid', 'pulls', 'punches', 'regards', 'drugs', 'sex', 'violence', 'hardcore', 'classic', 'use', 'word', 'br', 'called', 'oz', 'nickname', 'given', 'oswald', 'maximum', 'security', 'state', 'penitentary', 'focuses', 'mainly', 'emerald', 'city', 'experimental', 'section', 'prison', 'cells', 'glass', 'fronts', 'face', 'inwards', 'privacy', 'high', 'agenda', 'em', 'city', 'home', 'manyaryans', 'muslims', 'gangstas', 'latinos', 'christians', 'italians', 'irish', 'moreso', 'scuffles', 'death', 'stares', 'dodgy', 'dealings', 'shady', 'agreements', 'far', 'away', 'br', 'main', 'appeal', 'fact', 'goes', 'shows', 'dare', 'forget', 'pretty', 'pictures', 'painted', 'mainstream', 'audiences', 'forget', 'charm', 'forget', 'romanceoz', 'mess', 'episode', 'saw', 'struck', 'nasty', 'surreal', 'ready', 'watched', 'developed', 'taste', 'oz', 'got', 'accustomed', 'high', 'levels', 'graphic', 'violence', 'violence', 'injustice', 'crooked', 'guards', 'sold', 'nickel', 'inmates', 'kill', 'order', 'away', 'mannered', 'middle', 'class', 'inmates', 'turned', 'prison', 'bitches', 'lack', 'street', 'skills', 'prison', 'experience', 'watching', 'oz', 'comfortable', 'uncomfortable', 'viewingthats', 'touch', 'darker']","['reviewer', 'mention', 'watch', 'oz', 'episode', 'hook', 'right', 'exactly', 'happen', 'br', 'thing', 'strike', 'oz', 'brutality', 'unflinche', 'scene', 'violence', 'set', 'right', 'word', 'trust', 'faint', 'hearted', 'timid', 'pull', 'punch', 'regard', 'drug', 'sex', 'violence', 'hardcore', 'classic', 'use', 'word', 'br', 'call', 'oz', 'nickname', 'give', 'oswald', 'maximum', 'security', 'state', 'penitentary', 'focus', 'mainly', 'emerald', 'city', 'experimental', 'section', 'prison', 'cell', 'glass', 'front', 'face', 'inward', 'privacy', 'high', 'agenda', 'em', 'city', 'home', 'manyaryan', 'muslims', 'gangstas', 'latinos', 'christians', 'italian', 'irish', 'moreso', 'scuffle', 'death', 'stare', 'dodgy', 'dealing', 'shady', 'agreement', 'far', 'away', 'br', 'main', 'appeal', 'fact', 'go', 'show', 'dare', 'forget', 'pretty', 'picture', 'paint', 'mainstream', 'audience', 'forget', 'charm', 'forget', 'romanceoz', 'mess', 'episode', 'see', 'strike', 'nasty', 'surreal', 'ready', 'watch', 'develop', 'taste', 'oz', 'get', 'accustom', 'high', 'level', 'graphic', 'violence', 'violence', 'injustice', 'crooked', 'guard', 'sell', 'nickel', 'inmate', 'kill', 'order', 'away', 'mannered', 'middle', 'class', 'inmate', 'turn', 'prison', 'bitch', 'lack', 'street', 'skill', 'prison', 'experience', 'watch', 'oz', 'comfortable', 'uncomfortable', 'viewingthat', 'touch', 'dark']"
"A wonderful little production. <br /><br />The filming technique is very unassuming- very old-time-BBC fashion and gives a comforting, and sometimes discomforting, sense of realism to the entire piece. <br /><br />The actors are extremely well chosen- Michael Sheen not only ""has got all the polari"" but he has all the voices down pat too! You can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to Williams' diary entries, not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece. A masterful production about one of the great master's of comedy and his life. <br /><br />The realism really comes home with the little things: the fantasy of the guard which, rather than use the traditional 'dream' techniques remains solid then disappears. It plays on our knowledge and our senses, particularly with the scenes concerning Orton and Halliwell and the sets (particularly of their flat with Halliwell's murals decorating every surface) are terribly well done.","a wonderful little production <br /><br />the filming technique is very unassuming- very old-time-bbc fashion and gives a comforting and sometimes discomforting sense of realism to the entire piece <br /><br />the actors are extremely well chosen- michael sheen not only ""has got all the polari"" but he has all the voices down pat too you can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to williams' diary entries not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece a masterful production about one of the great master's of comedy and his life <br /><br />the realism really comes home with the little things: the fantasy of the guard which rather than use the traditional 'dream' techniques remains solid then disappears it plays on our knowledge and our senses particularly with the scenes concerning orton and halliwell and the sets (particularly of their flat with halliwell's murals decorating every surface) are terribly well done","['wonderful', 'little', 'production', 'br', 'filming', 'technique', 'old', 'time', 'bbc', 'fashion', 'gives', 'comforting', 'discomforting', 'sense', 'realism', 'entire', 'piece', 'br', 'actors', 'extremely', 'michael', 'sheen', 'got', 'polari', 'voices', 'pat', 'truly', 'seamless', 'editing', 'guided', 'references', 'williams', 'diary', 'entries', 'worth', 'watching', 'terrificly', 'written', 'performed', 'piece', 'masterful', 'production', 'great', 'master', 'comedy', 'life', 'br', 'realism', 'comes', 'home', 'little', 'things', 'fantasy', 'guard', 'use', 'traditional', 'dream', 'techniques', 'remains', 'solid', 'disappears', 'plays', 'knowledge', 'senses', 'particularly', 'scenes', 'concerning', 'orton', 'halliwell', 'sets', 'particularly', 'flat', 'halliwell', 'murals', 'decorating', 'surface', 'terribly']","['wonderful', 'little', 'production', 'br', 'filming', 'technique', 'old', 'time', 'bbc', 'fashion', 'give', 'comfort', 'discomforte', 'sense', 'realism', 'entire', 'piece', 'br', 'actor', 'extremely', 'michael', 'sheen', 'get', 'polari', 'voice', 'pat', 'truly', 'seamless', 'editing', 'guide', 'reference', 'williams', 'diary', 'entry', 'worth', 'watching', 'terrificly', 'write', 'perform', 'piece', 'masterful', 'production', 'great', 'master', 'comedy', 'life', 'br', 'realism', 'come', 'home', 'little', 'thing', 'fantasy', 'guard', 'use', 'traditional', 'dream', 'technique', 'remain', 'solid', 'disappear', 'play', 'knowledge', 'sense', 'particularly', 'scene', 'concern', 'orton', 'halliwell', 'set', 'particularly', 'flat', 'halliwell', 'mural', 'decorate', 'surface', 'terribly']"
"I thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend, sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a light-hearted comedy. The plot is simplistic, but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable (even the well bread suspected serial killer). While some may be disappointed when they realize this is not Match Point 2: Risk Addiction, I thought it was proof that Woody Allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love.<br /><br />This was the most I'd laughed at one of Woody's comedies in years (dare I say a decade?). While I've never been impressed with Scarlet Johanson, in this she managed to tone down her ""sexy"" image and jumped right into a average, but spirited young woman.<br /><br />This may not be the crown jewel of his career, but it was wittier than ""Devil Wears Prada"" and more interesting than ""Superman"" a great comedy to go see with friends.","i thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a light-hearted comedy the plot is simplistic but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable (even the well bread suspected serial killer) while some may be disappointed when they realize this is not match point 2: risk addiction i thought it was proof that woody allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love<br /><br />this was the most i'd laughed at one of woody's comedies in years (dare i say a decade) while i've never been impressed with scarlet johanson in this she managed to tone down her ""sexy"" image and jumped right into a average but spirited young woman<br /><br />this may not be the crown jewel of his career but it was wittier than ""devil wears prada"" and more interesting than ""superman"" a great comedy to go see with friends","['thought', 'wonderful', 'way', 'spend', 'time', 'hot', 'summer', 'weekend', 'sitting', 'air', 'conditioned', 'theater', 'watching', 'light', 'hearted', 'comedy', 'plot', 'simplistic', 'dialogue', 'witty', 'characters', 'likable', 'bread', 'suspected', 'serial', 'killer', 'disappointed', 'realize', 'match', 'point', 'risk', 'addiction', 'thought', 'proof', 'woody', 'allen', 'fully', 'control', 'style', 'grown', 'love', 'br', 'laughed', 'woody', 'comedies', 'years', 'dare', 'decade', 'impressed', 'scarlet', 'johanson', 'managed', 'tone', 'sexy', 'image', 'jumped', 'right', 'average', 'spirited', 'young', 'woman', 'br', 'crown', 'jewel', 'career', 'wittier', 'devil', 'wears', 'prada', 'interesting', 'superman', 'great', 'comedy', 'friends']","['think', 'wonderful', 'way', 'spend', 'time', 'hot', 'summer', 'weekend', 'sit', 'air', 'condition', 'theater', 'watch', 'light', 'hearted', 'comedy', 'plot', 'simplistic', 'dialogue', 'witty', 'character', 'likable', 'bread', 'suspect', 'serial', 'killer', 'disappoint', 'realize', 'match', 'point', 'risk', 'addiction', 'think', 'proof', 'woody', 'allen', 'fully', 'control', 'style', 'grow', 'love', 'br', 'laugh', 'woody', 'comedy', 'year', 'dare', 'decade', 'impress', 'scarlet', 'johanson', 'manage', 'tone', 'sexy', 'image', 'jump', 'right', 'average', 'spirited', 'young', 'woman', 'br', 'crown', 'jewel', 'career', 'witty', 'devil', 'wear', 'prada', 'interesting', 'superman', 'great', 'comedy', 'friend']"

"Petter Mattei's ""Love in the Time of Money"" is a visually stunning film to watch. Mr. Mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations. This is a movie that seems to be telling us what money, power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter. <br /><br />This being a variation on the Arthur Schnitzler's play about the same theme, the director transfers the action to the present time New York where all these different characters meet and connect. Each one is connected in one way, or another to the next person, but no one seems to know the previous point of contact. Stylishly, the film has a sophisticated luxurious look. We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat.<br /><br />The only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits. A big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment, as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter.<br /><br />The acting is good under Mr. Mattei's direction. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier, and the rest of the talented cast, make these characters come alive.<br /><br />We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work.","petter mattei's ""love in the time of money"" is a visually stunning film to watch mr mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations this is a movie that seems to be telling us what money power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter <br /><br />this being a variation on the arthur schnitzler's play about the same theme the director transfers the action to the present time new york where all these different characters meet and connect each one is connected in one way or another to the next person but no one seems to know the previous point of contact stylishly the film has a sophisticated luxurious look we are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat<br /><br />the only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits a big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter<br /><br />the acting is good under mr mattei's direction steve buscemi rosario dawson carol kane michael imperioli adrian grenier and the rest of the talented cast make these characters come alive<br /><br />we wish mr mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work","['petter', 'mattei', 'love', 'time', 'money', 'visually', 'stunning', 'film', 'watch', 'mr', 'mattei', 'offers', 'vivid', 'portrait', 'human', 'relations', 'movie', 'telling', 'money', 'power', 'success', 'people', 'different', 'situations', 'encounter', 'br', 'variation', 'arthur', 'schnitzler', 'play', 'theme', 'director', 'transfers', 'action', 'present', 'time', 'new', 'york', 'different', 'characters', 'meet', 'connect', 'connected', 'way', 'person', 'know', 'previous', 'point', 'contact', 'stylishly', 'film', 'sophisticated', 'luxurious', 'look', 'taken', 'people', 'live', 'world', 'live', 'habitat', 'br', 'thing', 'gets', 'souls', 'picture', 'different', 'stages', 'loneliness', 'inhabits', 'big', 'city', 'exactly', 'best', 'place', 'human', 'relations', 'find', 'sincere', 'fulfillment', 'discerns', 'case', 'people', 'encounter', 'br', 'acting', 'good', 'mr', 'mattei', 'direction', 'steve', 'buscemi', 'rosario', 'dawson', 'carol', 'kane', 'michael', 'imperioli', 'adrian', 'grenier', 'rest', 'talented', 'cast', 'characters', 'come', 'alive', 'br', 'wish', 'mr', 'mattei', 'good', 'luck', 'await', 'anxiously', 'work']","['petter', 'mattei', 'love', 'time', 'money', 'visually', 'stunning', 'film', 'watch', 'mr', 'mattei', 'offer', 'vivid', 'portrait', 'human', 'relation', 'movie', 'tell', 'money', 'power', 'success', 'people', 'different', 'situation', 'encounter', 'br', 'variation', 'arthur', 'schnitzler', 'play', 'theme', 'director', 'transfer', 'action', 'present', 'time', 'new', 'york', 'different', 'character', 'meet', 'connect', 'connect', 'way', 'person', 'know', 'previous', 'point', 'contact', 'stylishly', 'film', 'sophisticated', 'luxurious', 'look', 'take', 'people', 'live', 'world', 'live', 'habitat', 'br', 'thing', 'get', 'soul', 'picture', 'different', 'stage', 'loneliness', 'inhabit', 'big', 'city', 'exactly', 'good', 'place', 'human', 'relation', 'find', 'sincere', 'fulfillment', 'discern', 'case', 'people', 'encounter', 'br', 'acting', 'good', 'mr', 'mattei', 'direction', 'steve', 'buscemi', 'rosario', 'dawson', 'carol', 'kane', 'michael', 'imperioli', 'adrian', 'grenier', 'rest', 'talented', 'cast', 'character', 'come', 'alive', 'br', 'wish', 'mr', 'mattei', 'good', 'luck', 'await', 'anxiously', 'work']"
"Probably my all-time favorite movie, a story of selflessness, sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause, but it's not preachy or boring. It just never gets old, despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years. Paul Lukas' performance brings tears to my eyes, and Bette Davis, in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles, is a delight. The kids are, as grandma says, more like ""dressed-up midgets"" than children, but that only makes them more fun to watch.

"This show was an amazing, fresh & innovative idea in the 70's when it first aired. The first 7 or 8 years were brilliant, but things dropped off after that.

"Encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here I was looking forward to watching this film. Bad mistake. I've seen 950+ films and this is truly one of the worst of them - it's awful in almost every way: editing, pacing, storyline, 'acting,' soundtrack (the film's only song - a lame country tune - is played no less than four times).

"I saw this movie when I was about 12 when it came out. I recall the scariest scene was the big bird eating men dangling helplessly from parachutes right out of the air. The horror. The horror.<br /><br />As a young kid going to these cheesy B films on Saturday afternoons, I still was tired of the formula for these monster type movies that usually included the hero, a beautiful woman who might be the daughter of a professor and a happy resolution when the monster died in the end. I didn't care much for the romantic angle as a 12 year old and the predictable plots. I love them now for the unintentional humor.<br /><br />But, about a year or so later, I saw Psycho when it came out and I loved that the star, Janet Leigh, was bumped off early in the film. I sat up and took notice at that point. Since screenwriters are making up the story, make it up to be as scary as possible and not from a well-worn formula.

"So im not a big fan of Boll's work but then again not many are. I enjoyed his movie Postal (maybe im the only one). Boll apparently bought the rights to use Far Cry long ago even before the game itself was even finsished. <br /><br />People who have enjoyed killing mercs and infiltrating secret research labs located on a tropical island should be warned, that this is not Far Cry... This is something Mr Boll have schemed together along with his legion of schmucks.. Feeling loneley on the set Mr Boll invites three of his countrymen to play with. These players go by the names of Til Schweiger, Udo Kier and Ralf Moeller.<br /><br />Three names that actually have made them selfs pretty big in the movie biz. So the tale goes like this, Jack Carver played by Til Schweiger (yes Carver is German all hail the bratwurst eating dudes!!) However I find that Tils acting in this movie is pretty badass.. People have complained about how he's not really staying true to the whole Carver agenda but we only saw carver in a first person perspective so we don't really know what he looked like when he was kicking a**.. <br /><br />However, the storyline in this film is beyond demented. We see the evil mad scientist Dr. Krieger played by Udo Kier, making Genetically-Mutated-soldiers or GMS as they are called. Performing his top-secret research on an island that reminds me of ""SPOILER"" Vancouver for some reason. Thats right no palm trees here. Instead we got some nice rich lumberjack-woods. We haven't even gone FAR before I started to CRY (mehehe) I cannot go on any more.. If you wanna stay true to Bolls shenanigans then go and see this movie you will not be disappointed it delivers the true Boll experience, meaning most of it will suck.<br /><br />There are some things worth mentioning that would imply that Boll did a good work on some areas of the film such as some nice boat and fighting scenes. Until the whole cromed/albino GMS squad enters the scene and everything just makes me laugh.. The movie Far Cry reeks of scheisse (that's poop for you simpletons) from a fa,r if you wanna take a wiff go ahead..

"Some films just simply should not be remade. This is one of them. In and of itself it is not a bad film. But it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title. Liam Neeson was excellent as he always is, and most of the cast holds up, with the exception of Owen Wilson, who just did not bring the right feel to the character of Luke. But the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the Shirley Jackson story in it's attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects. Again I will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film.

"An awful film! It must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the Golden Globe. They've taken the story of the first famous female Renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition. My complaint is not that they've taken liberties with the facts; if the story were good, that would perfectly fine. But it's simply bizarre -- by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film, so why did they come up with this dishwater-dull script? I suppose there weren't enough naked people in the factual version. It's hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artist's life -- we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if they'd favored the rest of the film with same brevity.",an awful film it must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the golden globe they've taken the story of the first famous female renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition my complaint is not that they've taken liberties with the facts; if the story were good that would perfectly fine but it's simply bizarre -- by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film so why did they come up with this dishwater-dull script i suppose there weren't enough naked people in the factual version it's hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artist's life -- we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if they'd favored the rest of the film with same brevity,"['awful', 'film', 'real', 'stinkers', 'nominated', 'golden', 'globe', 'taken', 'story', 'famous', 'female', 'renaissance', 'painter', 'mangled', 'recognition', 'complaint', 'taken', 'liberties', 'facts', 'story', 'good', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'simply', 'bizarre', 'accounts', 'true', 'story', 'artist', 'far', 'better', 'film', 'come', 'dishwater', 'dull', 'script', 'suppose', 'naked', 'people', 'factual', 'version', 'hurriedly', 'capped', 'end', 'summary', 'artist', 'life', 'saved', 'couple', 'hours', 'favored', 'rest', 'film', 'brevity']","['awful', 'film', 'real', 'stinker', 'nominate', 'golden', 'globe', 'take', 'story', 'famous', 'female', 'renaissance', 'painter', 'mangle', 'recognition', 'complaint', 'take', 'liberty', 'fact', 'story', 'good', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'simply', 'bizarre', 'account', 'true', 'story', 'artist', 'far', 'well', 'film', 'come', 'dishwater', 'dull', 'script', 'suppose', 'naked', 'people', 'factual', 'version', 'hurriedly', 'cap', 'end', 'summary', 'artist', 'life', 'save', 'couple', 'hour', 'favor', 'rest', 'film', 'brevity']"
"After the success of Die Hard and it's sequels it's no surprise really that in the 1990s, a glut of 'Die Hard on a .....' movies cashed in on the wrong guy, wrong place, wrong time concept. That is what they did with Cliffhanger, Die Hard on a mountain just in time to rescue Sly 'Stop or My Mom Will Shoot' Stallone's career.<br /><br />Cliffhanger is one big nit-pickers dream, especially to those who are expert at mountain climbing, base-jumping, aviation, facial expressions, acting skills. All in all it's full of excuses to dismiss the film as one overblown pile of junk. Stallone even managed to get out-acted by a horse! However, if you an forget all the nonsense, it's actually a very lovable and undeniably entertaining romp that delivers as plenty of thrills, and unintentionally, plenty of laughs.<br /><br />You've got to love John Lithgows sneery evilness, his tick every box band of baddies, and best of all, the permanently harassed and hapless 'turncoat' agent, Rex Linn as Travers.<br /><br />He may of been Henry in 'Portrait of a Serial Killer' but Michael Rooker is noteworthy for a cringe-worthy performance as Hal, he insists on constantly shrieking in painful disbelief at his captors 'that man never hurt anybody' And whilst he surely can't be, it really does look like Ralph Waite's Frank character is grinning as the girl plummets to her death.<br /><br />Mention too must go to former 'London's Burning' actor Craig Fairbrass as the Brit bad guy, who comes a cropper whilst using Hal as a Human Football, yes, you can't help enjoy that bit, Hal needed a good kicking.<br /><br />So forget your better judgement, who cares if 'that could never happen', lower your acting expectations, turn up the volume and enjoy!

"First of all, let's get a few things straight here: a) I AM an anime fan- always has been as a matter of fact (I used to watch Speed Racer all the time in Preschool). b) I DO like several B-Movies because they're hilarious. c) I like the Godzilla movies- a lot.<br /><br />Moving on, when the movie first comes on, it seems like it's going to be your usual B-movie, down to the crappy FX, but all a sudden- BOOM! the anime comes on! This is when the movie goes WWWAAAAAYYYYY downhill.<br /><br />The animation is VERY bad & cheap, even worse than what I remember from SPEED RACER, for crissakes! In fact, it's so cheap, one of the few scenes from the movie I ""vividly"" remember is when a bunch of kids run out of a school... & it's the same kids over & over again! The FX are terrible, too; the dinosaurs look worse than Godzilla. In addition, the transition to live action to animation is unorganized, the dialogue & voices(especially the English dub that I viewed) was horrid & I was begging my dad to take the tape out of the DVD/ VHS player; The only thing that kept me surviving was cracking out jokes & comments like the robots & Joel/Mike on MST3K (you pick the season). Honestly, this is the only way to barely enjoy this movie & survive it at the same time.<br /><br />Heck, I'm planning to show this to another fellow otaku pal of mine on Halloween for a B-Movie night. Because it's stupid, pretty painful to watch & unintentionally hilarious at the same time, I'm giving this movie a 3/10, an improvement from the 0.5/10 I was originally going to give it.<br /><br />(According to my grading scale: 3/10 means Pretty much both boring & bad.

This was the worst movie I saw at WorldFest and it also received the least amount of applause afterwards! I can only think it is receiving such recognition based on the amount of known actors in the film. It's great to see J.Beals but she's only in the movie for a few minutes. M.Parker is a much better actress than the part allowed for. The rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable. The main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore a bore to watch. There is no real emotional depth to the story. A movie revolving about an actor who can't get work doesn't feel very original to me. Nor does the development of the cop. It feels like one of many straight-to-video movies I saw back in the 90s ... And not even a good one in those standards.<br /><br />,this was the worst movie i saw at worldfest and it also received the least amount of applause afterwards i can only think it is receiving such recognition based on the amount of known actors in the film it's great to see jbeals but she's only in the movie for a few minutes mparker is a much better actress than the part allowed for the rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable the main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore a bore to watch there is no real emotional depth to the story a movie revolving about an actor who can't get work doesn't feel very original to me nor does the development of the cop it feels like one of many straight-to-video movies i saw back in the 90s  and not even a good one in those standards<br /><br />,"['worst', 'movie', 'saw', 'worldfest', 'received', 'applause', 'think', 'receiving', 'recognition', 'based', 'known', 'actors', 'film', 'great', 'jbeals', 'movie', 'minutes', 'mparker', 'better', 'actress', 'allowed', 'rest', 'acting', 'hard', 'judge', 'movie', 'ridiculous', 'predictable', 'main', 'character', 'totally', 'unsympathetic', 'bore', 'watch', 'real', 'emotional', 'depth', 'story', 'movie', 'revolving', 'actor', 'work', 'feel', 'original', 'development', 'cop', 'feels', 'like', 'straight', 'video', 'movies', 'saw', 'good', 'standards', 'br']","['bad', 'movie', 'see', 'worldfest', 'receive', 'applause', 'think', 'receive', 'recognition', 'base', 'know', 'actor', 'film', 'great', 'jbeal', 'movie', 'minute', 'mparker', 'well', 'actress', 'allow', 'rest', 'acting', 'hard', 'judge', 'movie', 'ridiculous', 'predictable', 'main', 'character', 'totally', 'unsympathetic', 'bore', 'watch', 'real', 'emotional', 'depth', 'story', 'movie', 'revolve', 'actor', 'work', 'feel', 'original', 'development', 'cop', 'feel', 'like', 'straight', 'video', 'movie', 'see', 'good', 'standard', 'br']"
"The Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about singer Karen Carpenter's complex life. Though it fails in giving accurate facts, and details.<br /><br />Cynthia Gibb (portrays Karen) was not a fine election.

"""The Cell"" is an exotic masterpiece, a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer, but also into one of a very talented director. This is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations. This is boldness at work, pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent. This is the best movie of the year to date.<br /><br />I've read numerous complaints about this film, anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting. To negatively criticize this film is to miss the point. This movie may be a landmark, a tradition where future movies will hopefully follow. ""The Cell"" has just opened the door to another world of imagination. So can we slam the door in its face and tell it and its director Tarsem Singh that we don't want any more? Personally, I would more than welcome another movie by Tarsem, and would love to see someone try to challenge him.<br /><br />We've all heard talk about going inside the mind of a serial killer, and yes, I do agree that the ""genre"" is a bit overworked. The 90s were full of movies trying to depict what makes serial killers tick; some of them worked, but most failed. But ""The Cell"" does not blaze down the same trail, we are given a new twist, we are physically transported into the mind and presented with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject matter ever studied.<br /><br />I like how the movie does not bog us down with too much scientific jargon trying to explain how Jennifer Lopez actually gets to enter the brain of another. Instead, she just lies down on a laboratory table and is wrapped with what looks like really long Twizzlers and jaunted into another entity. ""The Cell"" wants to let you ""see"" what it's all about and not ""how"" it's all about, and I guess that's what some people don't like. True, I do like explanations with my movies, but when a movie ventures onto new ground you must let it do what it desires and simply take it in.<br /><br />I noticed how the film was very dark when it showed reality, maybe to contrast the bright visuals when inside the brain of another. Nonetheless, the set design was simply astonishing. I wouldn't be surprised if this film took home a few Oscars in cinematography, best costumes, best director and the like. If it were up to me it'd at least get nominated for best picture.<br /><br />I've noticed that I've kind of been repeating myself. Not because there's nothing else to say, but because I can't stress enough how fantastic I thought ""The Cell"" was. If you walk into the movie with a very open mind and to have it taken over with wonders and an eye-popping feast then you are assured a good time. I guess this film was just a little too much for some people, writing it off as ""weird"" or ""crazy"". I am very much into psychology and the imagination of the human mind, so it was right down my alley. Leaving the theater, I heard one audience member say ""Whoever made that movie sure did a lot of good drugs."" If so, I want what he was smoking.<br /><br />**** (out of 4)","""the cell"" is an exotic masterpiece a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer but also into one of a very

"'War movie' is a Hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that clichéd dialogue, rehashed plot and over-the-top action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with large-scale combat. Once in a while, however, a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen. The Civil War-era ""Cold Mountain,"" starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renée Zellweger is such a film.<br /><br />Then again, calling Cold Mountain"" a war movie is not entirely accurate. True enough, the film opens with a (quite literally) quick-and-dirty battle sequence that puts ""Glory"" director Edward Zwick shame. However, ""Cold Mountain"" is not so much about the Civil War itself as it is about the period and the people of the times. The story centers around disgruntled Confederate soldier Inman, played by Jude Law, who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of Cold Mountain, North Carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind, Ada Monroe, played by Nicole Kidman. At first glance, this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier's tribulations on the battlefield. Indeed, the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived.<br /><br />""Cold Mountain"" soon takes a drastic turn, though, as the intrepid hero Inman turns out to be a deserter (incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the Confederates) and begins a long odyssey homeward. Meanwhile, back at the farm, Ada's cultured ways prove of little use in the fields; soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast. Coming to Ada's rescue is the course, tough-as-nails Ruby Thewes, played by Renée Zellweger, who helps Ada put the farm back together and, perhaps more importantly, cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon Ada.<br /><br />Within these two settings, a vivid, compelling and, at times, very disturbing portrait of the war-torn South unfolds. The characters with whom Inman and Ada interact are surprisingly complex, enhanced by wonderful performances of Brendan Gleeson as Ruby's deadbeat father, Ray Winstone as an unrepentant southern ""lawman,"" and Natalie Portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother. All have been greatly affected and changed by ""the war of Northern aggression,"" mostly for the worse. The dark, pervading anti-war message, accented by an effective, haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of Virginia and North Carolina, is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought. Though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century, it's hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant.<br /><br />Director Anthony Minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film, but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters. The love story between Inman and Ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film, though the inherently distant, abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot.<br /><br />Make no mistake, ""Cold Mountain"" has neither the traits of a feel-good romance nor an inspiring war drama. It is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether.","'war movie' is a hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that clichd dialogue rehashed plot and over-the-top action sequences seem unavoidable for any

"Taut and organically gripping, Edward Dmytryk's Crossfire is a distinctive suspense thriller, an unlikely ""message"" movie using the look and devices of the noir cycle.<br /><br />Bivouacked in Washington, DC, a company of soldiers cope with their restlessness by hanging out in bars. Three of them end up at a stranger's apartment where Robert Ryan, drunk and belligerent, beats their host (Sam Levene) to death because he happens to be Jewish. Police detective Robert Young investigates with the help of Robert Mitchum, who's assigned to Ryan's outfit. Suspicion falls on the second of the three (George Cooper), who has vanished. Ryan slays the third buddy (Steve Brodie) to insure his silence before Young closes in.<br /><br />Abetted by a superior script by John Paxton, Dmytryk draws precise performances from his three starring Bobs. Ryan, naturally, does his prototypical Angry White Male (and to the hilt), while Mitchum underplays with his characteristic alert nonchalance (his role, however, is not central); Young may never have been better. Gloria Grahame gives her first fully-fledged rendition of the smart-mouthed, vulnerable tramp, and, as a sad sack who's leeched into her life, Paul Kelly haunts us in a small, peripheral role that he makes memorable.<br /><br />The politically engaged Dmytryk perhaps inevitably succumbs to sermonizing, but it's pretty much confined to Young's reminiscence of how his Irish grandfather died at the hands of bigots a century earlier (thus, incidentally, stretching chronology to the limit). At least there's no attempt to render an explanation, however glib, of why Ryan hates Jews (and hillbillies and...).<br /><br />Curiously, Crossfire survives even the major change wrought upon it -- the novel it's based on (Richard Brooks' The Brick Foxhole) dealt with a gay-bashing murder. But homosexuality in 1947 was still Beyond The Pale. News of the Holocaust had, however, begun to emerge from the ashes of Europe, so Hollywood felt emboldened to register its protest against anti-Semitism (the studios always quaked at the prospect of offending any potential ticket buyer).<br /><br />But while the change from homophobia to anti-Semitism works in general, the specifics don't fit so smoothly. The victim's chatting up a lonesome, drunk young soldier then inviting him back home looks odd, even though (or especially since) there's a girlfriend in tow. It raises the question whether this scenario was retained inadvertently or left in as a discreet tip-off to the original engine generating Ryan's murderous rage.","taut and organically gripping edward

"""Ardh Satya"" is one of the finest film ever made in Indian Cinema. Directed by the great director Govind Nihalani, this one is the most successful Hard Hitting Parallel Cinema which also turned out to be a Commercial Success. Even today, Ardh Satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of India.<br /><br />The film tells the Real-life Scenario of Mumbai Police of the 70s. Unlike any Police of other cities in India, Mumbai Police encompasses a Different system altogether. Govind Nihalani creates a very practical Outlay with real life approach of Mumbai Police Environment.<br /><br />Amongst various Police officers & colleagues, the film describes the story of Anand Velankar, a young hot-blooded Cop coming from a poor family. His father is a harsh Police Constable. Anand himself suffers from his father's ideologies & incidences of his father's Atrocities on his mother. Anand's approach towards immediate action against crime, is an inert craving for his own Job satisfaction. The film is here revolved in a Plot wherein Anand's constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniors.This leads to frustrations, as he cannot achieve the desired Job-satisfaction. Resulting from the frustrations, his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms & bars, also turning him to an alcoholic.<br /><br />The Spirit within him is still alive, as he constantly fights the system. He is aware of the system of the Metro, where the Police & Politicians are a inertly associated by far end. His compromise towards unethical practice is negative. Finally he gets suspended.<br /><br />The Direction is a master piece & thoroughly hard core. One of the best memorable scenes is when Anand breaks in the Underworld gangster Rama Shetty's house to arrest him, followed by short conversation which is fantastic. At many scenes, the film has Hair-raising moments.<br /><br />The Practical approach of Script is a major Punch. Alcoholism, Corruption, Political Influence, Courage, Deceptions all are integral part of Mumbai police even today. Those aspects are dealt brilliantly.<br /><br />Finally, the films belongs to the One man show, Om Puri portraying Anand Velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly.","""ardh

"One of the most significant quotes from the entire film is pronounced halfway through by the protagonist, the mafia middle-man Titta Di Girolamo, a physically non-descript, middle-aged man originally from Salerno in Southern Italy. When we're introduced to him at the start of the film, he's been living a non-life in an elegant but sterile hotel in the Italian-speaking Canton of Switzerland for the last ten years, conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to. While this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the Swiss bank who normally count Di Girolamo's cash tell him that 10,000 dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes. At the news, he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account. Meanwhile he tells us, the spectators, that when you bluff, you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous. He says: you can't bluff for a while and then halfway through, tell the truth. Having eventually done this - bluffed only halfway through and told the truth, and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately, love - is exactly the reason behind the beginning of Titta Di Girolamo's troubles. <br /><br />This initially unsympathetic character, a scowling, taciturn, curt man on the verge of 50, a man who won't even reply in kind to chambermaids and waitresses who say hello and goodbye, becomes at one point someone the spectator cares deeply about. At one point in his non-life, Titta decides to feel concern about appearing ""ridiculous"". The first half of the film may be described as ""slow"" by some. It does indeed reveal Di Girolamo's days and nights in that hotel at an oddly disjoined, deliberate pace, revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details. However, scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes. The existence of Titta Di Girolamo - the man with no imagination, identity or life, the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling for when you least thought you would - is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music (one theme by the Scottish band Boards of Canada especially stood out). <br /><br />Never was the contrast between the way Hollywood and Italy treat mobsters more at odds than since the release of films such as Le Conseguenze dell'Amore or L'Imbalsamatore. Another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the protagonist's insomnia. Not unlike The Machinist (and in a far more explicit way, the Al Pacino film Insomnia), Le Conseguenze dell'Amore uses this condition to symbolise a deeper emotional malaise that's been rammed so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious, it's almost impossible to pin-point its cause (if indeed there is one). <br /><br />The young and sympathetic hotel waitress Sofia (played by Olivia Magnani, grand-daughter of the legendary Anna) and the memory of Titta's best friend, a man whom he hasn't seen in 20 years, unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that Titta eventually (though tentatively at first) accepts to look through again. Though it's never explicitly spelt out, the spectator KNOWS that to a man like Titta, accepting The Consequences of Love will have unimaginable consequences. A film without a single scene of sex or violence, a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectator's expectations, Le Conseguenze dell'Amore is a fine representative of that small, quiet, discreet Renaissance that has been taking place in Italian cinema since the decline of Cinecittà during the second half of the 70s. The world is waiting for Italy to produce more Il Postino-like fare, more La Vita è Bella-style films... neglecting to explore fine creations like Le Conseguenze dell'Amore, L'Imbalsamatore and others.

"I watched this film not really expecting much, I got it in a pack of 5 films, all of which were pretty terrible in their own way for under a fiver so what could I expect? and you know what I was right, they were all terrible, this movie has a few (and a few is stretching it) interesting points, the occasional camcorder view is a nice touch, the drummer is very like a drummer, i.e damned annoying and, well thats about it actually, the problem is that its just so boring, in what I can only assume was an attempt to build tension, a whole lot of nothing happens and when it does its utterly tedious (I had my thumb on the fast forward button, ready to press for most of the movie, but gave it a go) and seriously is the lead singer of the band that great looking, coz they don't half mention how beautiful he is a hell of a lot, I thought he looked a bit like a meercat, all this and I haven't even mentioned the killer, I'm not even gonna go into it, its just not worth explaining. Anyway as far as I'm concerned Star and London are just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of London (who was actually quite funny) it wasn't because of their acting talent, I've certainly seen a lot worse, but I've also seen a lot better.

"I bought this film at Blockbuster for $3.00, because it sounded interesting (a bit Ranma-esque, with the idea of someone dragging around a skeleton), because there was a cute girl in a mini-skirt on the back, and because there was a Restricted Viewing sticker on it. I thought it was going to be a sweet or at least sincere coming of age story with a weird indie edge. I was 100% wrong.<br /><br />Having watched it, I have to wonder how it got the restricted sticker, since there is hardly any foul language, little violence, and the closest thing to nudity (Honestly! I don't usually go around hoping for it!) is when the girl is in her nightgown and you see her panties (you see her panties a lot in this movie, because no matter what, she's wearing a miniskirt of some sort). Even the anti-religious humor is tame (and lame, caricatured, insincere, derivative, unoriginal, and worst of all not funny in the slightest--it would be better just to listen to Ray Stevens' ""Would Jesus Wear a Rolex on His Television Show""). This would barely qualify as PG-13 (it is Not Rated), but Blockbuster refuses to let anyone under the age of 17 rent this--as if it was pornographic. Any little kid could go in there and rent the edited version of Requiem for a Dream, but they insist that Zack and Reba is worse.<br /><br />It is, but not in that way.<br /><br />In a way, this worries me--the only thing left that could offend people is the idea of the suicide at the beginning. If anybody needs to see movies with honestly portrayed suicides (not this one, but better ones like The Virgin Suicides), it's teenagers. If both of those movies were rated R purely because of the suicide aspect, then I have little chance of turning a story I've been writing into a PG-13 movie (the main characters are eleven and a half and twelve). Suicide is one of the top three leading causes of death in teenagers (I think it's number 2), so chances are that most teens have been or will be affected by it.<br /><br />Just say no to this movie, though. 2/10.","i bought this film at blockbuster for $300 because it sounded interesting (a bit ranma-esque with the idea of someone dragging around a skeleton) because there was a cute girl in a

"Ever watched a movie that lost the plot? Well, this didn't even really have one to begin with.<br /><br />Where to begin? The achingly tedious scenes of our heroine sitting around the house with actually no sense of menace or even foreboding created even during the apparently constant thunderstorms (that are strangely never actually heard in the house-great double glazing)? The house that is apparently only a few miles from a town yet is several hours walk away(?) or the third girl who serves no purpose to the plot except to provide a surprisingly quick gory murder just as the tedium becomes unbearable? Or even the beginning which suggests a spate of 20+ killings throughout the area even though it is apparent the killer never ventures far from the house? Or the bizarre ritual with the salt & pepper that pretty much sums up most of the films inherent lack of direction.<br /><br />Add a lead actress who can't act but at least is willing to do some completely irrelevant nude shower scenes and this video is truly nasty, but not in the way you hope.<br /><br />Given a following simply for being banned in the UK in the 80's (mostly because of a final surprisingly over extended murder) it offers nothing but curiosity value- and one classic 'daft' murder (don't worry-its telegraphed at least ten minutes before).<br /><br />After a walk in the woods our victim comes to a rather steep upward slope which they obviously struggle up. Halfway through they see a figure at the top dressed in black and brandishing a large scythe. What do they do? Slide down and run like the rest of us?

Call me a conspiracy theorist, but quotes like, ""We have to steal the Declaration of Independence to protect it"" seem like ways to justify actions like the invasion of Iraq, etc. The fact that Nicholas Cage spews lines like, ""I would never use the Declaration of Independence as a bargaining chip"" with a straight face made me and my husband wonder whether the entire cast took Valium before shooting each scene. The ""reasoning"" behind each plot turn and new ""clue"" is truly ridiculous and impossible to follow. And there's also a bonus side plot of misogyny, with Dr. Whatever-Her-Name-Was being chided by all involved for ""never shutting up."" She's clearly in the movie only for looks, but they felt the need to slap a ""Dr."" title on her character to give her some gravity. At one point, Cage's character says, ""Don't you ever shut up?"" and the camera pans to her looking poutily down at her hands, like she's a child. Truly grotesque. The only benefit to this movie was that it's so astonishingly bad, you do get a few laughs out of it. The really scary thing is that a majority of the people watching the movie with us seemed to enjoy it. Creepy....","after sitting through this pile of dung my husband and i wondered whether it was actually the product of an experiment to see whether a computer program could produce a movie it was that listless and formulaic but the us propaganda thrown in your face throughout the film proves--disappointingly--that it's the work of humans call me a conspiracy theorist but quotes like ""we have to steal the declaration of independence to protect it"" seem like ways to justify actions like the invasion of iraq etc the fact that nicholas cage spews lines like ""i would never use the declaration of independence as a bargaining chip"" with a straight face made me and my husband wonder whether the entire cast took valium before shooting each scene the ""reasoning"" behind each plot turn and new ""clue"" is truly ridiculous and impossible to follow and there's also a bonus side plot of misogyny with dr whatever-her-name-was being chided by all involved for ""never shutting up"" she's clearly in the movie only for looks but they felt the need to slap a ""dr"" title on her character to give her some gravity at one point cage's character says ""don't you ever shut up"" and the camera pans to her looking poutily down at her hands like she's a child truly grotesque the only benefit to this movie was that it's so astonishingly bad you do get a few laughs out of it the really scary thing is that a majority of the people watching the movie with us seemed to enjoy it creepy","['sitting', 'pile', 'dung', 'husband', 'wondered', 'actually', 'product', 'experiment', 'computer', 'program', 'produce', 'movie', 'listless', 'formulaic', 'propaganda', 'thrown', 'face', 'film', 'proves', 'disappointingly', 'work', 'humans', 'conspiracy', 'theorist', 'quotes', 'like', 'steal', 'declaration', 'independence', 'protect', 'like', 'ways', 'justify', 'actions', 'like', 'invasion', 'iraq', 'etc', 'fact', 'nicholas', 'cage', 'spews', 'lines', 'like', 'use', 'declaration', 'independence', 'bargaining', 'chip', 'straight', 'face', 'husband', 'wonder', 'entire', 'cast', 'took', 'valium', 'shooting', 'scene', 'reasoning', 'plot', 'turn', 'new', 'clue', 'truly', 'ridiculous', 'impossible', 'follow', 'bonus', 'plot', 'misogyny', 'dr', 'chided', 'involved', 'shutting', 'clearly', 'movie', 'looks', 'felt', 'need', 'slap', 'dr', 'title', 'character', 'gravity', 'point', 'cage', 'character', 'says', 'shut', 'camera', 'pans', 'looking', 'poutily', 'hands', 'like', 'child', 'truly', 'grotesque', 'benefit', 'movie', 'astonishingly', 'bad', 'laughs', 'scary', 'thing', 'majority', 'people', 'watching', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'creepy']","['sit', 'pile', 'dung', 'husband', 'wonder', 'actually', 'product', 'experiment', 'computer', 'program', 'produce', 'movie', 'listless', 'formulaic', 'propaganda', 'throw', 'face', 'film', 'prove', 'disappointingly', 'work', 'human', 'conspiracy', 'theorist', 'quote', 'like', 'steal', 'declaration', 'independence', 'protect', 'like', 'way', 'justify', 'action', 'like', 'invasion', 'iraq', 'etc', 'fact', 'nicholas', 'cage', 'spew', 'line', 'like', 'use', 'declaration', 'independence', 'bargaining', 'chip', 'straight', 'face', 'husband', 'wonder', 'entire', 'cast', 'take', 'valium', 'shoot', 'scene', 'reasoning', 'plot', 'turn', 'new', 'clue', 'truly', 'ridiculous', 'impossible', 'follow', 'bonus', 'plot', 'misogyny', 'dr', 'chide', 'involve', 'shut', 'clearly', 'movie', 'look', 'feel', 'need', 'slap', 'dr', 'title', 'character', 'gravity', 'point', 'cage', 'character', 'say', 'shut', 'camera', 'pan', 'look', 'poutily', 'hand', 'like', 'child', 'truly', 'grotesque', 'benefit', 'movie', 'astonishingly', 'bad', 'laugh', 'scary', 'thing', 'majority', 'people', 'watch', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'creepy']"

"This movie is based on the book, ""A Many Splendored Thing"" by Han Suyin and tackles issues of race relations between Asians and Whites, a topic that comes from Han's personal experiences as an Eurasian growing up in China. That background, and the beautiful Hong Kong settings, gives this love story a unique and rather daring atmosphere for its time.<br /><br />Other than that, the story is a stereotypical romance with a memorable song that is perhaps more remembered than the movie itself. The beautiful Jennifer Jones looks the part and gives a wonderful, Oscar nominated performance as a doctor of mixed breed during the advent of Communism in mainland China. William Holden never looked better playing a romantic lead as a journalist covering war torn regions in the world. The acting is top notch, and the chemistry between the two lovers provides for some genuine moments of silver screen affection sure to melt the hearts of those who are romantically inclined.<br /><br />The cinematography really brings out fifty's Hong Kong, especially the hilltop overlooking the harbor where the two lovers spend their most intimate moments. The ending is a real tear-jerker. Some may consider sentimental romances passé, but, for those who enjoy classic Hollywood love stories, this is a shining example.","this movie is based on the book ""a many splendored thing"" by han suyin and tackles issues of race relations between asians and whites a topic that comes from han's personal experiences as an eurasian growing up in china that background and the beautiful hong kong settings gives this love story a unique and rather daring atmosphere for its time<br /><br />other than that the story is a stereotypical romance with a memorable song that is perhaps more remembered than the movie itself the beautiful jennifer jones looks the part and gives a wonderful oscar nominated performance as a doctor of mixed breed during the advent of communism in mainland china william holden never looked better playing a romantic lead as a journalist covering war torn regions in the world the acting is top notch and the chemistry between the two lovers provides for some genuine moments of silver screen affection sure to melt the hearts of those who are romantically inclined<br /><br />the cinematography really brings out fifty's hong kong especially the hilltop overlooking the harbor where the two lovers spend their most intimate moments the ending is a real tear-jerker some may consider sentimental romances pass but for those who enjoy classic hollywood love stories this is a shining example","['movie', 'based', 'book', 'splendored', 'thing', 'han', 'suyin', 'tackles', 'issues', 'race', 'relations', 'asians', 'whites', 'topic', 'comes', 'han', 'personal', 'experiences', 'eurasian', 'growing', 'china', 'background', 'beautiful', 'hong', 'kong', 'settings', 'gives', 'love', 'story', 'unique', 'daring', 'atmosphere', 'time', 'br', 'story', 'stereotypical', 'romance', 'memorable', 'song', 'remembered', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'jennifer', 'jones', 'looks', 'gives', 'wonderful', 'oscar', 'nominated', 'performance', 'doctor', 'mixed', 'breed', 'advent', 'communism', 'mainland', 'china', 'william', 'holden', 'looked', 'better', 'playing', 'romantic', 'lead', 'journalist', 'covering', 'war', 'torn', 'regions', 'world', 'acting', 'notch', 'chemistry', 'lovers', 'provides', 'genuine', 'moments', 'silver', 'screen', 'affection', 'sure', 'melt', 'hearts', 'romantically', 'inclined', 'br', 'cinematography', 'brings', 'hong', 'kong', 'especially', 'hilltop', 'overlooking', 'harbor', 'lovers', 'spend', 'intimate', 'moments', 'ending', 'real', 'tear', 'jerker', 'consider', 'sentimental', 'romances', 'pass', 'enjoy', 'classic', 'hollywood', 'love', 'stories', 'shining', 'example']","['movie', 'base', 'book', 'splendored', 'thing', 'han', 'suyin', 'tackle', 'issue', 'race', 'relation', 'asians', 'white', 'topic', 'come', 'han', 'personal', 'experience', 'eurasian', 'grow', 'china', 'background', 'beautiful', 'hong', 'kong', 'setting', 'give', 'love', 'story', 'unique', 'dare', 'atmosphere', 'time', 'br', 'story', 'stereotypical', 'romance', 'memorable', 'song', 'remember', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'jennifer', 'jones', 'look', 'give', 'wonderful', 'oscar', 'nominate', 'performance', 'doctor', 'mixed', 'breed', 'advent', 'communism', 'mainland', 'china', 'william', 'holden', 'look', 'well', 'play', 'romantic', 'lead', 'journalist', 'cover', 'war', 'tear', 'region', 'world', 'acting', 'notch', 'chemistry', 'lover', 'provide', 'genuine', 'moment', 'silver', 'screen', 'affection', 'sure', 'melt', 'heart', 'romantically', 'inclined', 'br', 'cinematography', 'bring', 'hong', 'kong', 'especially', 'hilltop', 'overlook', 'harbor', 'lover', 'spend', 'intimate', 'moment', 'ending', 'real', 'tear', 'jerker', 'consider', 'sentimental', 'romance', 'pass', 'enjoy', 'classic', 'hollywood', 'love', 'story', 'shine', 'example']"

""How could ANYONE come up with something so crappy""? Gary Busey is know for his ""B"" movies, but this is a sure ""W"" movie. (W=waste).<br /><br />Take for example: about two dozen FBI & local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer. Inside the jeep is MA and is ""confused"" as to why all the cops are about. Within seconds a huge gun battle ensues, MA being killed straight off. The cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them. The cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with Gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bullet/pellet. MA is killed and gary seems to not to have noticed-damn that guy is tough.

"I had heard good things about ""States of Grace"" and came in with an open mind. I thought that ""God's Army"" was okay, and I thought that maybe Dutcher had improved and matured as a filmmaker. The film began with some shaky acting, and I thought, ""well, maybe it will get better."" Unfortunately, it never did. The picture starts out by introducing two elders -- Mormon missionaries -- and it seems that the audience will get to know them and grow to care about them. Instead, the story degenerates into a highly improbable series of unfortunate events highlighting blatant disobedience by the missionaries (something that undeniably exists, but rarely on the level that Dutcher portrays) and it becomes almost laughable.<br /><br />Dutcher's only success in this movie is his successful alienation of his target audience. By unrealistically and inaccurately portraying the lives of Mormon missionaries, Dutcher accomplishes nothing more than angering his predominantly Mormon audience. The film in no way reflects reality. Missions are nothing like what Dutcher shows (having served a Mormon mission myself I can attest to this fact) and gang life in California certainly contains much more explicit language than the occasional mild vulgarity.<br /><br />The conclusion, which I'm assuming was supposed to touch the audience and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to all, was both unbelievable (c'mon, the entire mission gathers to see this elder sent home -- and the mom and the girl are standing right next to each other!) and cheesy. Next time, Dutcher, try making a movie that SOMEONE can identify with.","i had heard good things about ""states of grace"" and came in with an open mind i thought that ""god's army"" was okay and i thought that maybe dutcher had improved and matured as a filmmaker the film began with some shaky acting and i thought ""well maybe it will get better"" unfortunately it never did the picture starts out by introducing two elders -- mormon missionaries -- and it seems that the audience will get to know them and grow to care about them instead the story degenerates into a highly improbable series of unfortunate events highlighting blatant disobedience by the missionaries (something that undeniably exists but rarely on the level that dutcher portrays) and it becomes almost laughable<br /><br />dutcher's only success in this movie is his successful alienation of his target audience by unrealistically and inaccurately portraying the lives of mormon missionaries dutcher accomplishes nothing more than angering his predominantly mormon audience the film in no way reflects reality missions are nothing like what dutcher shows (having served a mormon mission myself i can attest to this fact) and gang life in california certainly contains much more explicit language than the occasional mild vulgarity<br /><br />the conclusion which i'm assuming was supposed to touch the audience and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to all was both unbelievable (c'mon the entire mission gathers to see this elder sent home -- and the mom and the girl are standing right next to each other) and cheesy next time dutcher try making a movie that someone can identify with","['heard', 'good', 'things', 'states', 'grace', 'came', 'open', 'mind', 'thought', 'god', 'army', 'okay', 'thought', 'maybe', 'dutcher', 'improved', 'matured', 'filmmaker', 'film', 'began', 'shaky', 'acting', 'thought', 'maybe', 'better', 'unfortunately', 'picture', 'starts', 'introducing', 'elders', 'mormon', 'missionaries', 'audience', 'know', 'grow', 'care', 'instead', 'story', 'degenerates', 'highly', 'improbable', 'series', 'unfortunate', 'events', 'highlighting', 'blatant', 'disobedience', 'missionaries', 'undeniably', 'exists', 'rarely', 'level', 'dutcher', 'portrays', 'laughable', 'br', 'success', 'movie', 'successful', 'alienation', 'target', 'audience', 'unrealistically', 'inaccurately', 'portraying', 'lives', 'mormon', 'missionaries', 'dutcher', 'accomplishes', 'angering', 'predominantly', 'mormon', 'audience', 'film', 'way', 'reflects', 'reality', 'missions', 'like', 'dutcher', 'shows', 'having', 'served', 'mormon', 'mission', 'attest', 'fact', 'gang', 'life', 'california', 'certainly', 'contains', 'explicit', 'language', 'occasional', 'mild', 'vulgarity', 'br', 'conclusion', 'assuming', 'supposed', 'touch', 'audience', 'inspire', 'believe', 'forgiveness', 'available', 'unbelievable', 'entire', 'mission', 'gathers', 'elder', 'sent', 'home', 'mom', 'girl', 'standing', 'right', 'cheesy', 'time', 'dutcher', 'try', 'making', 'movie', 'identify']","['hear', 'good', 'thing', 'state', 'grace', 'come', 'open', 'mind', 'think', 'god', 'army', 'okay', 'think', 'maybe', 'dutcher', 'improve', 'mature', 'filmmaker', 'film', 'begin', 'shaky', 'acting', 'think', 'maybe', 'well', 'unfortunately', 'picture', 'start', 'introduce', 'elder', 'mormon', 'missionary', 'audience', 'know', 'grow', 'care', 'instead', 'story', 'degenerate', 'highly', 'improbable', 'series', 'unfortunate', 'event', 'highlight', 'blatant', 'disobedience', 'missionary', 'undeniably', 'exist', 'rarely', 'level', 'dutcher', 'portray', 'laughable', 'br', 'success', 'movie', 'successful', 'alienation', 'target', 'audience', 'unrealistically', 'inaccurately', 'portray', 'life', 'mormon', 'missionary', 'dutcher', 'accomplish', 'anger', 'predominantly', 'mormon', 'audience', 'film', 'way', 'reflect', 'reality', 'mission', 'like', 'dutcher', 'show', 'having', 'serve', 'mormon', 'mission', 'attest', 'fact', 'gang', 'life', 'california', 'certainly', 'contain', 'explicit', 'language', 'occasional', 'mild', 'vulgarity', 'br', 'conclusion', 'assume', 'suppose', 'touch', 'audience', 'inspire', 'believe', 'forgiveness', 'available', 'unbelievable', 'entire', 'mission', 'gather', 'elder', 'send', 'home', 'mom', 'girl', 'stand', 'right', 'cheesy', 'time', 'dutcher', 'try', 'make', 'movie', 'identify']"

"As a disclaimer, I've seen the movie 5-6 times in the last 15 years, and I only just saw the musical this week. This allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or wasn't in the musical (however, it tainted me when I watched the musical :) ) <br /><br />I actually believe Michael Douglas worked quite well in that role, along with Kasey. I think her 'Let me dance for you scene' is one of the best parts of the movie, a worthwhile addition compared to the musical. The dancers and singing in the movie are much superior to the musical, as well as the cast which is at least 10 times bigger (easier to do in the movie of course). The decors, lighting, dancing, and singing are also much superior in the movie, which should be expected, and was indeed delivered. <br /><br />The songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie, the new ones are quite good ones, and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion, especially compared to a musical which has few decors.

It was as historically accurate as Xena and Hercules. Abraham and Moses got melded into Noah. Lot, Abraham's nephew, Lot, turns up thousands of years before he would have been born. Canaanites wandered the earth...really? What were the scriptwriters thinking? Was it just ignorance (""I remember something about Noah and animals, and Lot and Canaanites and all that stuff from Sunday School"") or were they trying to offend the maximum number of people on the planet as possible- from Christians, Jews and Muslims, to historians, archaeologists, geologists, psychologists, linguists ...as a matter of fact, did anyone not get offended?

"Preston Sturgis' THE POWER AND THE GLORY was unseen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty years until the late 1990s when it resurfaced and even showed up on television. In the meantime it had gained in notoriety because Pauline Kael's THE CITIZEN KANE BOOK had suggested that the Herman Mankiewicz - Orson Welles screenplay for KANE was based on Sturgis' screenplay here. As is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the IMDb web site, Kael overstated her case.<br /><br />There are about six narrators who take turns dealing with the life of Charles Foster Kane: the newsreel (representing Ralston - the Henry Luce clone), Thatcher's memoirs, Bernstein, Jed Leland, Susan Alexander Kane, and Raymond the butler. Each has his or her different slant on Kane, reflecting their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man. And of course each also reveals his or her own failings when they are telling their version of Kane's story. This method also leads to frequent overlapping re-tellings of the same incident.<br /><br />This is not the situation in THE POWER AND THE GLORY. Yes, like KANE it is about a legendary business leader - here it is Tom Garner (Spencer Tracy), a man who rose from the bottom to being head of the most successful railroad system in the country. But there are only two narrators - they are Garner's right hand man Henry (Ralph Morgan) and his wife (Sarah Padden). This restricts the nearly three dimensional view we get at times of Kane in Garner. Henry, when he narrates, is talking about his boss and friend, whom he respected and loved. His wife is like the voice of the skeptical public - she sees only the flaws in Henry.<br /><br />Typical example: Although he worked his way up, Tom becomes more and more anti-labor in his later years. Unions are troublemakers, and he does not care to be slowed down by their shenanigans. Henry describes Tom's confrontation with the Union in a major walk-out, and how it preoccupied him to the detriment of his home life. But Henry's wife reminds him how Tom used scabs and violence to end the strike (apparently blowing up the Union's headquarters - killing many people). So we have two views of the man but one is pure white and one is pure black.<br /><br />I'm not really knocking THE POWER AND THE GLORY for not duplicating KANE's success (few films do - including all of Orson Welles' other films), but I am aware that the story is presented well enough to hold one's interest to the end. And thanks to the performances of Tracy and Colleen Moore as his wife Sally, the tragedy of the worldly success of the pair is fully brought home.<br /><br />When they marry, Tom wants to do well (in part) to give his wife and their family the benefits he never had. But in America great business success comes at a cost. Tom gets deeply involved with running the railroad empire (he expands it and improves it constantly). But it takes him away from home too much, and he loses touch with Sally. And he also notices Eve (Helen Vinson), the younger woman who becomes his mistress. When Sally learns of his unfaithful behavior it destroys her.<br /><br />Similarly Tom too gets a full shock (which makes him a martyr in the eyes of Henry). Eve marries Tom, and presents him with a son - but it turns out to be Eve's son by Tom's son Tom Jr. (Philip Trent). The discovery of this incestuous cuckolding causes Tom to shoot himself.<br /><br />The film is not a total success - the action jumps at times unconvincingly. Yet it does make the business seem real (note the scene when Tom tells his Board of Directors about his plans to purchase a small rival train line, and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans). Sturgis came from a wealthy background, so he could bring in this type of detail. So on the whole it is a first rate film. No CITIZEN KANE perhaps, but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in Depression America.",preston sturgis' the power and the glory was unseen by the

"Return to the 36th Chamber is one of those classic Kung-Fu movies which Shaw produces back in the 70s and 80s, whose genre is equivalent to the spaghetti westerns of Hollywood, and the protagonist Gordon Liu, the counterpart to the western's Clint Eastwood. Digitally remastered and a new print made for the Fantastic Film Fest, this is ""Presented in Shaw Scope"", just like the good old days.<br /><br />This film is a simple story of good versus evil, told in 3 acts, which more or less sums up the narrative of martial arts films in that era.<br /><br />Act One sets up the premise. Workers in a dye-mill of a small village are unhappy with their lot, having their wages cut by 20% by incoming manchu gangsters. They can't do much about their exploitation because none of them are martial arts skilled to take on the gangsters, and their boss. At first they had a minor success in getting Liu to impersonate a highly skilled Shaolin monk (one of the best comedy sequences), but their rouse got exposed when they pushed the limit of credibility by impersonating one too many times.<br /><br />Act Two shows the protagonist wanting to get back at the mob. However, without real martial arts, he embarks on a journey to Shaolin Temple, to try and infiltrate and learn martial arts on the sly. After some slapstick moments, he finally gets accepted by the abbot (whom he impersonated!) but is disappointed at the teaching methods - kinda like Mr Miyagi's style in Karate Kid, but instead of painting fences, he gets to erect scaffoldings all around the temple. Nothing can keep a good man down, and he unwittingly builds strength, endurance and learns kung-fu the unorthodox way.<br /><br />Act Three is where the fight fest begins. With cheesy sound effects, each obvious non-contact on film is given the maximum impact treatment. But it is rather refreshing watching the fight scenes here, with its wide angled shots to highlight clarity and detail between the sparring partners, and the use of slow-motion only to showcase stunts in different angles. You may find the speed of fights a tad too slow, with some pause in between moves, but with Yuen Wo Ping and his style being used ad-nausem in Hollywood flicks, they sure don't make fight scenes like they used to!

"***SPOILERS*** All too, in real life as well as in the movies, familiar story that happens to many young men who are put in a war zone with a gun, or rifle, in their hands. The case of young and innocent, in never handling or firing a gun, Jimmy Davis, Franchot Tone, has been repeated thousands of times over the centuries when men, like Jimmy Davis, are forced to take up arms for their country.<br /><br />Jimmy who at first wanted to be kicked out of the US Army but was encouraged to stay, by being belted in the mouth, by his good friend Fred P. Willis, Spencer Tracy, ended up on the front lines in France. With Jimmy's unit pinned down by a German machine gun nest he single handedly put it out of commission picking off some half dozen German soldiers from the safety of a nearby church steeple. It was when Jimmy gunned down the last surviving German, who raised his arms in surrender, that an artillery shell hit the steeple seriously wounding him.<br /><br />Recovering from his wounds at an Army hospital Jimmy fell in love with US Army volunteer nurse Rose Duffy, Gladys George. Rose was really in love with Jimmy's good friend the happy go lucky Fred despite his obnoxious antics towards her. It's when Fred was lost during the fighting on the Western Front that Rose, thinking that he was killed, fell in love and later married Jimmy. When Fred unexpectedly showed up in the French town where Jimmy, now fully recovered from his wounds, was stationed at things got very sticky for both him and Rose who had already accepted Jimmy's proposal of marriage to her!<br /><br />With WWI over and Jimmy marrying Rose left Fred, who's still in love with her, a bitter and resentful young man. It was almost by accident that Fred ran into Jimmy on the streets of New York City and discovered to his shock and surprise that he completely changed from the meek and non-violent person that he knew before he was sent to war on the European Western Front. Smug and sure of himself, and his ability to shoot a gun, Jimmy had become a top mobster in New York City's underworld! Not only that but as Fred later found out his wife Rose had no idea what Jimmy was really involved in with Jimmy telling her that he works as a law abiding and inoffensive insurance adjuster.<br /><br />Jimmy's life of crime came full circle when Rose, after she found out about his secret life, ratted him out to the police to prevent him from executing a ""Valentine Day"" like massacre, with his gang members dressed as cops, of his rival mobsters. While on trial Jimmy came to his senses and admitted his guilt willing to face the music and then, after his three year sentence is up, get his life back together. <br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT*** Hearing rumors from fellow convicts that Rose and his best friend Fred were having an affair behind his back Jimmy broke out of prison ending up a fugitive from the law. It's at Fred's circus, where he works as both manger and barker, that Jimmy in seeing that Rose as well as Fred were true to him that he, like at his trial, had a sudden change of heart. But the thought of going back to prison, with at least another ten years added on to his sentence, was just too much for Jimmy! It was then that Jimmy decided to end it all by letting the police who by then tracked him down do the job, that he himself didn't have the heart to do, for him!","***spoilers*** all too in real life

"Bela Lugosi appeared in several of these low budget chillers for Monogram Studios in the 1940's and The Corpse Vanishes is one of the better ones.<br /><br />Bela plays a mad scientist who kidnaps young brides and kills them and then extracts fluid from their bodies so he can keep his ageing wife looking young. After a reporter and a doctor stay the night at his home and discover he is responsible for the brides' deaths, the following morning they report these murders to the police and the mad scientist is shot and drops dead shortly afterwards.<br /><br />You have got almost everything in this movie: the scientist's assistants consist of an old hag, a hunchback and dwarf (her sons), a thunderstorm and spooky passages in Bela's house. Bela and his wife find they sleep better in coffins rather than beds in the movie.<br /><br />The Corpse Vanishes is worth a look, especially for Bela Lugosi fans.

"The 33 percent of the nations nitwits that still support W. Bush would do well to see this movie, which shows the aftermath of the French revolution and the terror of 1794 as strikingly similar to the post 9/11 socio-political landscape. Maybe then they could stop worrying about saving face and take the a**-whupping they deserve. It's really a shame that when a politician ruins the country, those who voted for him can't be denied the right to ever vote again. They've clearly shown they have no sense of character.<br /><br />What really stands out in this movie is the ambiguity of a character as hopelessly doctrinaire as Robespierre; a haunted empty man who simplistic reductive ideology can't help him elucidate the boundaries between safety and totalitarianism.

"As someone has already mentioned on this board, it's very difficult to make a fake documentary. It requires tremendous skill, pacing, patience, directorial 'distance,' a plausible premise, a narrative 'flow,' and REALLY believable acting (aka GREAT acting). <br /><br />Such is not the case with 'Love Machine'. It starts to show its faux hand about the 20-minute mark (with 60 minutes left to watch), and the viewer starts to realize that he or she is being taken in. It's downhill from there.<br /><br />Director Gordon Eriksen simply peaked too soon. But to be fair to Eriksen, his problems started early: as he explains in the extras, he began wanting to do a REAL doc, couldn't get funding, and settled for a cheaper way of making his film.<br /><br />The premise -- people who have secret lives by posting themselves on a porn website -- was perhaps more interesting in 1997-98, when the film was made. Eriksen does a lot of tricky stuff -- a pushy 'host,' hand-held cameras, zooms, grainy blacks and whites -- all, I guess, to elicit a sense of authenticity, but it just doesn't work. The film is confusing and forced, but what ultimately brings it down is the believability of the actors and the pretty awful dialogue.",as someone has already mentioned on this board it's very difficult to make a fake documentary it requires tremendous skill pacing patience directorial 'distance' a plausible premise a narrative 'flow' and really believable acting (aka great acting) <br /><br />such is not the case with 'love machine' it starts to show its faux hand about the 20-minute mark (with 60 minutes left to watch) and the viewer starts to realize that he or she is being taken in it's downhill from there<br /><br />director gordon eriksen simply peaked too soon but to be fair to eriksen his problems started early: as he explains in the extras he began wanting to do a real doc couldn't get funding and settled for a cheaper way of making his film<br /><br />the premise -- people who have secret lives by posting themselves on a porn website -- was perhaps more interesting in 1997-98 when the film was made eriksen does a lot of tricky stuff -- a pushy 'host' hand-held cameras zooms grainy blacks and whites -- all i guess to elicit a sense of authenticity but it just doesn't work the film is confusing and forced but what ultimately brings it down is the believability of the actors and the pretty awful dialogue,"['mentioned', 'board', 'difficult', 'fake', 'documentary', 'requires', 'tremendous', 'skill', 'pacing', 'patience', 'directorial', 'distance', 'plausible', 'premise', 'narrative', 'flow', 'believable', 'acting', 'aka', 'great', 'acting', 'br', 'case', 'love', 'machine', 'starts', 'faux', 'hand', 'minute', 'mark', 'minutes', 'left', 'watch', 'viewer', 'starts', 'realize', 'taken', 'downhill', 'br', 'gordon', 'eriksen', 'simply', 'peaked', 'soon', 'fair', 'eriksen', 'problems', 'started', 'early', 'explains', 'extras', 'began', 'wanting', 'real', 'doc', 'funding', 'settled', 'cheaper', 'way', 'making', 'film', 'br', 'premise', 'people', 'secret', 'lives', 'posting', 'porn', 'website', 'interesting', 'film', 'eriksen', 'lot', 'tricky', 'stuff', 'pushy', 'host', 'hand', 'held', 'cameras', 'zooms', 'grainy', 'blacks', 'whites', 'guess', 'elicit', 'sense', 'authenticity', 'work', 'film', 'confusing', 'forced', 'ultimately', 'brings', 'believability', 'actors', 'pretty', 'awful', 'dialogue']","['mention', 'board', 'difficult', 'fake', 'documentary', 'require', 'tremendous', 'skill', 'pace', 'patience', 'directorial', 'distance', 'plausible', 'premise', 'narrative', 'flow', 'believable', 'acting', 'aka', 'great', 'acting', 'br', 'case', 'love', 'machine', 'start', 'faux', 'hand', 'minute', 'mark', 'minute', 'leave', 'watch', 'viewer', 'start', 'realize', 'take', 'downhill', 'br', 'gordon', 'eriksen', 'simply', 'peak', 'soon', 'fair', 'eriksen', 'problem', 'start', 'early', 'explain', 'extra', 'begin', 'want', 'real', 'doc', 'funding', 'settle', 'cheap', 'way', 'make', 'film', 'br', 'premise', 'people', 'secret', 'life', 'post', 'porn', 'website', 'interesting', 'film', 'eriksen', 'lot', 'tricky', 'stuff', 'pushy', 'host', 'hand', 'hold', 'camera', 'zoom', 'grainy', 'black', 'white', 'guess', 'elicit', 'sense', 'authenticity', 'work', 'film', 'confusing', 'force', 'ultimately', 'bring', 'believability', 'actor', 'pretty', 'awful', 'dialogue']"
"The Hills Have Eyes II is what you would expect it to be and nothing more. Of course it's not going to be an Oscar nominated film, it's just pure entertainment which you can just lose yourself in for 90 minutes.<br /><br />The plot is basically about a group of National Guard trainees who find themselves battling against the notorious mutated hillbillies on their last day of training in the desert.

"I laughed all the way through this rotten movie. It's so unbelievable. A woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage, has a breakdown in front of a real estate office. What happens? The office manager comes outside and offers her a job!!! Hilarious! Next thing you know the two women are going at it. Yep, they're lesbians! Nothing rings true in this ""Lifetime for Women with nothing better to do"" movie. Clunky dialogue like ""I don't want to spend the rest of my life feeling like I had a chance to be happy and didn't take it"" doesn't help. There's a wealthy, distant mother who disapproves of her daughter's new relationship. A sassy black maid - unbelievable that in the year 2003, a film gets made in which there's a sassy black maid. Hattie McDaniel must be turning in her grave. The woman has a husband who freaks out and wants custody of the snotty teenage kids. Sheesh! No cliche is left unturned.","i laughed all the way through this rotten movie it's so unbelievable a woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage has a breakdown in front of a real estate office what happens the office manager comes outside and offers her a job hilarious next thing you know the two women are going at it yep they're lesbians nothing rings true in this ""lifetime for women with nothing better to do"" movie clunky dialogue like ""i don't want to spend the rest of my life feeling like i had a chance to be happy and didn't take it"" doesn't help there's a wealthy distant mother who disapproves of her daughter's new relationship a sassy black maid - unbelievable that in the year 2003 a film gets made in which there's a sassy black maid hattie mcdaniel must be turning in her grave the woman has a husband who freaks out and wants custody of the snotty teenage kids sheesh no cliche is left unturned","['laughed', 'way', 'rotten', 'movie', 'unbelievable', 'woman', 'leaves', 'husband', 'years', 'marriage', 'breakdown', 'real', 'estate', 'office', 'happens', 'office', 'manager', 'comes', 'outside', 'offers', 'job', 'hilarious', 'thing', 'know', 'women', 'going', 'yep', 'lesbians', 'rings', 'true', 'lifetime', 'women', 'better', 'movie', 'clunky', 'dialogue', 'like', 'want', 'spend', 'rest', 'life', 'feeling', 'like', 'chance', 'happy', 'help', 'wealthy', 'distant', 'mother', 'disapproves', 'daughter', 'new', 'relationship', 'sassy', 'black', 'maid', 'unbelievable', 'year', 'film', 'gets', 'sassy', 'black', 'maid', 'hattie', 'mcdaniel', 'turning', 'grave', 'woman', 'husband', 'freaks', 'wants', 'custody', 'snotty', 'teenage', 'kids', 'sheesh', 'cliche', 'left', 'unturned']","['laugh', 'way', 'rotten', 'movie', 'unbelievable', 'woman', 'leave', 'husband', 'year', 'marriage', 'breakdown', 'real', 'estate', 'office', 'happen', 'office', 'manager', 'come', 'outside', 'offer', 'job', 'hilarious', 'thing', 'know', 'woman', 'go', 'yep', 'lesbian', 'ring', 'true', 'lifetime', 'woman', 'well', 'movie', 'clunky', 'dialogue', 'like', 'want', 'spend', 'rest', 'life', 'feel', 'like', 'chance', 'happy', 'help', 'wealthy', 'distant', 'mother', 'disapprove', 'daughter', 'new', 'relationship', 'sassy', 'black', 'maid', 'unbelievable', 'year', 'film', 'get', 'sassy', 'black', 'maid', 'hattie', 'mcdaniel', 'turn', 'grave', 'woman', 'husband', 'freak', 'want', 'custody', 'snotty', 'teenage', 'kid', 'sheesh', 'cliche', 'leave', 'unturned']"
"NO SPOILERS!!<br /><br />After Hitchcock's successful first American film, Rebecca based upon Daphne DuMarier's lush novel of gothic romance and intrigue, he returned to some of the more familiar themes of his early British period - mistaken identity and espionage. As the U.S. settled into World War II and the large scale 'war effort' of civilians building planes, weaponry and other necessary militia, the booming film entertainment business began turning out paranoid and often jingoistic thrillers with war time themes. These thrillers often involved networks of deceptive and skilled operators at work in the shadows among the good, law abiding citizens. Knowing the director was at home in this espionage genre, producer Jack Skirball approached Hitchcock about directing a property he owned that dealt with corruption, war-time sabotage and a helpless hero thrust into a vortex of coincidence and mistaken identity. The darker elements of the narrative and the sharp wit of literary maven Dorothy Parker (during her brief stint in Hollywood before returning to her bohemian roots in NYC) who co-authored the script were a perfect match for Hitchcock's sensibilities.<br /><br />This often neglected film tells the story of the unfortunate 25 year old Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) who, while at work at a Los Angeles Airplane Factory, meets new employee Frank Frye (Norman Lloydd) and moments later is framed for committing sabotage. Fleeing the authorities who don't believe his far-fetched story he meets several characters on his way to Soda City Utah and finally New York City. These memorable characters include a circus caravan with a car full of helpful 'freaks' and a popular billboard model Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane) who, during the worst crisis of his life as well as national security, he falls madly in love with! Of course in the land of Hitchcock, Patricia, kidnapped by the supposed saboteur Barry, falls for her captor thus adding romantic tension to the mix.<br /><br />In good form for this outing, Hitchcock brews a national network of demure old ladies, average Joes, and respectable businessmen who double as secret agent terrorists that harbor criminals, pull guns and detonate bombs to keep things moving. It's a terrific plot that takes its time moving forward and once ignited, culminates in one of Hitchcock's more memorable finales. Look for incredibly life like NYC tourist attractions (all of which were recreated by art directors in Hollywood due to the war-time 'shooting ban' on public attractions). While Saboteur may not be one of Hitchcock's most well known films, it's a popular b-movie that is certainly solid and engaging with plenty of clever plot twists and as usual - terrific Hitchcock villains. Remember to look for Hitchcock's cameo appearance outside a drug store in the second half of the film. Hitchcock's original cameo idea that was shot (him fighting in sign language with his 'deaf' wife) was axed by the Bureau of Standards and Practices who were afraid of offending the deaf!",no

"I just watched The Dresser this evening, having only seen it once before, about a dozen years ago.<br /><br />It's not a ""big"" movie, and doesn't try to make a big splash, but my God, the brilliance of the two leads leaves me just about speechless. Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this movie.<br /><br />The Dresser is the story of Sir, an aging Shakespearean actor (Finney), and his dresser Norman (Courtenay), sort of a valet, putting on a production of King Lear during the blitz of London in World War II. These are two men, each dependent upon the other: Sir is almost helpless without the aid of Norman to cajole, wheedle, and bully him into getting onstage for his 227th performance of Lear. And Norman lives his life vicariously through Sir; without Sir to need him, he is nothing, or thinks he is, anyway.<br /><br />This is a character-driven film; the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters, and as such, it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life. Finney, only 47 years old, is completely believable as a very old, very sick, petulant, bullying, but brilliant stage actor. He hisses and fumes at his fellow actors even when they're taking their bows! And Courtenay is no less convincing as the mincing dresser, who must sometimes act more as a mother than as a valet to his elderly employer. Employer is really the wrong term to use, though. For although, technically their relationship is that of employer and employee, most of the time Sir and Norman act like nothing so much as an old married couple.<br /><br />Yes, there are others in the cast of this movie, but there is no question that the true stars are Finney, Courtenay, and the marvelous script by Ronald Harwood. That is not to say that there aren't other fine performances, most notably Eileen Atkins as the long-suffering stage manager Madge. There is a wonderful scene where Sir and Madge talk about old desires, old regrets, and what might have been.<br /><br />Although it doesn't get talked about these days, it is worth remembering that The Dresser was nominated for five Academy Awards: Best Actor nominations for both Finney and Courtenay, Best Picture, Best Director (Peter Yates), and Best Adapted Screenplay.<br /><br />I had remembered this as being a good movie, but I wasn't prepared to be as completely mesmerized as I was from beginning to end. If you want to see an example of what great acting is all about, and be hugely entertained all the while, then I encourage you to see The Dresser.","i just watched the dresser this evening having only

"What happened? What we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast, but somewhere the movie loses it. Actually, it never really got going. There was a little excitement when we find out that Angie is not really pregnant, then find out that she is after all, but that was it. Steve Martin, who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie, was dreadful and his entire character was not even close to being important to this movie, other than to make it longer.

"DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING is one of Fulci's earlier (and honestly, in terms of story-line, better...) films - and although not the typical ""bloodbath"" that Fulci is known for - this is still a very unique and enjoyable film.<br /><br />The story surrounds a small town where a series of child murders are occurring. Some of the colorful characters involved in the investigations - either as suspects, or those ""helping"" the investigation (or in some cases both) - include the towns police force, a small-time reporter, a beautiful and rich ex-drug addict, a young priest and his mother, An old man who practices witchcraft and his female protégé, a mentally handicapped townsman, and a deaf/mute little girl. All of these people are interwoven into the plot to create several twists and turns, until the actual killer is revealed...<br /><br />DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING is neither a ""classical"" giallo or a typical Fulci gore film. Although it does contain elements of both - it is more of an old-fashioned murder mystery, with darker subject matter and a few scenes of graphic violence (although nothing nearly as strong as some of Fulci's later works). This is a well written film with lots of twists that kept me guessing up until the end. Recommended for giallo/murder-mystery fans, or anyone looking to check out some of Fulci's non-splatter films - but don't despair, DON'T TORTURE still has more than it's fair share of violence and sleaze. Some may be put off by the subject of the child killings, and one main female character has a strange habit of hitting on very young boys, which is also kind of disconcerting - but if that type of material doesn't bother you, then definitely give this one a look. 8.5/10","don't torture a duckling is one of fulci's earlier (and honestly in terms of story-line better) films - and although not the typical ""bloodbath"" that fulci is known for - this is still a very unique and enjoyable film<br /><br />the story surrounds a small town where a series of child murders are occurring some of the colorful characters involved in the investigations - either as suspects or those ""helping"" the investigation (or in some cases both) - include the towns police force a small-time reporter a beautiful and rich ex-drug addict a young priest and his mother an old man who practices witchcraft and his female protg a mentally handicapped townsman and a deaf/mute little girl all of these people are interwoven into the plot to create several twists and turns until the actual killer is revealed<br /><br />don't torture a duckling is neither a ""classical"" giallo or a typical fulci gore film although it does contain elements of both - it is more of an old-fashioned murder mystery with darker subject matter and a few scenes of graphic violence (although nothing nearly as strong as some of fulci's later works) this is a well written film with lots of twists that kept me guessing up until the end recommended for giallo/murder-mystery fans or anyone looking to check out some of fulci's non-splatter films - but don't despair don't torture still has more than it's fair share of violence and sleaze some may be put off by the subject of the child killings and one main female character has a strange habit of hitting on very young boys which is also kind of disconcerting - but if that type of material doesn't bother you then definitely give this one a look 85/10","['torture', 'duckling', 'fulci', 'earlier', 'honestly', 'terms', 'story', 'line', 'better', 'films', 'typical', 'bloodbath', 'fulci', 'known', 'unique', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'br', 'story', 'surrounds', 'small', 'town', 'series', 'child', 'murders', 'occurring', 'colorful', 'characters', 'involved', 'investigations', 'suspects', 'helping', 'investigation', 'cases', 'include', 'towns', 'police', 'force', 'small', 'time', 'reporter', 'beautiful', 'rich', 'ex', 'drug', 'addict', 'young', 'priest', 'mother', 'old', 'man', 'practices', 'witchcraft', 'female', 'protg', 'mentally', 'handicapped', 'townsman', 'deaf', 'mute', 'little', 'girl', 'people', 'interwoven', 'plot', 'create', 'twists', 'turns', 'actual', 'killer', 'revealed', 'br', 'torture', 'duckling', 'classical', 'giallo', 'typical', 'fulci', 'gore', 'film', 'contain', 'elements', 'old', 'fashioned', 'murder', 'mystery', 'darker', 'subject', 'matter', 'scenes', 'graphic', 'violence', 'nearly', 'strong', 'fulci', 'later', 'works', 'written', 'film', 'lots', 'twists', 'kept', 'guessing', 'end', 'recommended', 'giallo', 'murder', 'mystery', 'fans', 'looking', 'check', 'fulci', 'non', 'splatter', 'films', 'despair', 'torture', 'fair', 'share', 'violence', 'sleaze', 'subject', 'child', 'killings', 'main', 'female', 'character', 'strange', 'habit', 'hitting', 'young', 'boys', 'kind', 'disconcerting', 'type', 'material', 'bother', 'definitely', 'look']","['torture', 'duckling', 'fulci', 'early', 'honestly', 'term', 'story', 'line', 'well', 'film', 'typical', 'bloodbath', 'fulci', 'know', 'unique', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'br', 'story', 'surround', 'small', 'town', 'series', 'child', 'murder', 'occur', 'colorful', 'character', 'involve', 'investigation', 'suspect', 'help', 'investigation', 'case', 'include', 'town', 'police', 'force', 'small', 'time', 'reporter', 'beautiful', 'rich', 'ex', 'drug', 'addict', 'young', 'priest', 'mother', 'old', 'man', 'practice', 'witchcraft', 'female', 'protg', 'mentally', 'handicapped', 'townsman', 'deaf', 'mute', 'little', 'girl', 'people', 'interweave', 'plot', 'create', 'twist', 'turn', 'actual', 'killer', 'reveal', 'br', 'torture', 'duckling', 'classical', 'giallo', 'typical', 'fulci', 'gore', 'film', 'contain', 'element', 'old', 'fashioned', 'murder', 'mystery', 'dark', 'subject', 'matter', 'scene', 'graphic', 'violence', 'nearly', 'strong', 'fulci', 'later', 'work', 'write', 'film', 'lot', 'twist', 'keep', 'guess', 'end', 'recommend', 'giallo', 'murder', 'mystery', 'fan', 'look', 'check', 'fulci', 'non', 'splatter', 'film', 'despair', 'torture', 'fair', 'share', 'violence', 'sleaze', 'subject', 'child', 'killing', 'main', 'female', 'character', 'strange', 'habit', 'hit', 'young', 'boy', 'kind', 'disconcert', 'type', 'material', 'bother', 'definitely', 'look']"
"Busty beauty Stacie Randall plays PVC clad, bad-ass bitch Alexandra, the faithful acolyte of Faust, an evil entity trapped in hell. Determined to free her master, the malevolent minx breaks into a warehouse to steal a magical gem vital to her success; but whilst conducting a satanic ritual to summon Faust, the silly mare accidentally enters the pentagram she has drawn on the floor, which results in the loss of the gem and the release of two diminutive, troll-like creatures called Lite and Dark.<br /><br />Now Alexandra must find a replacement gem, which isn't going to be easy: the only other stone that will do the trick is worn around the neck of her ex-lover, police detective Jonathan Graves (Peter Liapis), who is investigating the warehouse robbery and who knows only too well what evil Alexandra is capable of. Meanwhile, wise-cracking inter-dimensional half-pints Lite and Dark get into all sorts of zany trouble as they try to find a way back home.<br /><br />In the warped movie world of Jim Wynorski, all females are big-breasted babes with the fashion sense of a cheap hooker.

"I'm not sure why the producers needed to trade on the name of a somewhat successful movie franchise because the title suggests that it is a sequel to the first three movies..which it is not. Even though Marques Houston did appear in ""HP3"", he played a totally different character (he was, eight years older) in this film. Okay...so Reid and Martin weren't the most talented and couldn't carry a film all by themselves..but to trade on the HP franchise seems to me that there could have made some sort of reference (albeit minor) to the earlier movies. I'm sure everyone who wanted to see it was ""hoodwinked""--into thinking that they were seeing a sequel--not a totally different film with a familiar name. And I'm sorry...Kym Whitley is not funny, and could not hold a candle to the late Robin Harris, Ketty Lester, or DC Curry in the earlier films. Although Meagen Good and Mari Morrow are a substantial visual diversion...I have to give this a THUMBS DOWN!! Just naming the film ""Down to the Last Minute"" would have been OK. Furthermore, the Hudlin brothers (who produced the first three movies) were not involved in the making of this film.","i'm not sure why the producers needed to trade on the name of a somewhat successful movie franchise because the title suggests that it is a sequel to the first three movieswhich it is not even though marques houston did appear in ""hp3"" he played a totally different character (he was eight years older) in this film okayso reid and martin weren't the most talented and couldn't carry a film all by themselvesbut to trade on the hp franchise seems to me that there could have made some sort of reference (albeit minor) to the earlier movies i'm sure everyone who wanted to see it was ""hoodwinked""--into thinking that they were seeing a sequel--not a totally different film with a familiar name and i'm sorrykym whitley is not funny and could not hold a candle to the late robin harris ketty lester or dc curry in the earlier films although meagen good and mari morrow are a substantial visual diversioni have to give this a thumbs down just naming the film ""down to the last minute"" would have been ok furthermore the hudlin brothers (who produced the first three movies) were not involved in the making of this film","['sure', 'producers', 'needed', 'trade', 'somewhat', 'successful', 'movie', 'franchise', 'title', 'suggests', 'sequel', 'movieswhich', 'marques', 'houston', 'appear', 'played', 'totally', 'different', 'character', 'years', 'older', 'film', 'okayso', 'reid', 'martin', 'talented', 'carry', 'film', 'themselvesbut', 'trade', 'hp', 'franchise', 'sort', 'reference', 'albeit', 'minor', 'earlier', 'movies', 'sure', 'wanted', 'thinking', 'seeing', 'sequel', 'totally', 'different', 'film', 'familiar', 'sorrykym', 'whitley', 'funny', 'hold', 'candle', 'late', 'robin', 'harris', 'ketty', 'lester', 'dc', 'curry', 'earlier', 'films', 'meagen', 'good', 'mari', 'morrow', 'substantial', 'visual', 'diversioni', 'thumbs', 'naming', 'film', 'minute', 'ok', 'furthermore', 'hudlin', 'brothers', 'produced', 'movies', 'involved', 'making', 'film']","['sure', 'producer', 'need', 'trade', 'somewhat', 'successful', 'movie', 'franchise', 'title', 'suggest', 'sequel', 'movieswhich', 'marques', 'houston', 'appear', 'play', 'totally', 'different', 'character', 'year', 'old', 'film', 'okayso', 'reid', 'martin', 'talented', 'carry', 'film', 'themselvesbut', 'trade', 'hp', 'franchise', 'sort', 'reference', 'albeit', 'minor', 'early', 'movie', 'sure', 'want', 'thinking', 'see', 'sequel', 'totally', 'different', 'film', 'familiar', 'sorrykym', 'whitley', 'funny', 'hold', 'candle', 'late', 'robin', 'harris', 'ketty', 'lester', 'dc', 'curry', 'early', 'film', 'meagen', 'good', 'mari', 'morrow', 'substantial', 'visual', 'diversioni', 'thumb', 'name', 'film', 'minute', 'ok', 'furthermore', 'hudlin', 'brother', 'produce', 'movie', 'involve', 'making', 'film']"
"This film laboured along with some of the most predictable story lines and shallow characters ever seen. The writer obviously bought the playbook ""How to write a space disaster movie"" and followed it play by play. In particular, the stereo-typical use of astronauts talking to their loved ones from outer space - putting on a brave show in the face of disaster - has been done time and time again.<br /><br />Max Q appears to have been written in the hope that the producers would throw $50 million at the project. But, judging by the latter half of the film which contained numerous lame attempts at special effects, the producers could only muster $50 thousand. To learn that the film was nominated for a ""Special Visual Effects"" Emmy has me absolutely gob-smacked.<br /><br />I think a handful of high school students with a pass in Media Studies could have created more believable effects!<br /><br />And the plot holes are too numerous to mention. But I will pick one out as an example. Now, I'm no NASA expert, but surely it's highly implausible that a worker attached to the shuttle simulator would suddenly hold a position of power in the control room when things start to go pear-shaped with the program. Surely there is someone more experienced at Mission Control who the Program Director would call on rather than a twenty-nine year old who has not been in the control room before.<br /><br />The only saving grace for this film is the work of Bill Campbell. He manages to make a good attempt at salvaging something out of the train wreck that is this script.<br /><br />I give this film 2 out of 10, with the above-average work of Bill Campbell in the lead role saving it from a lower mark.","this film laboured along with some of the most predictable story lines and shallow characters ever seen the writer obviously bought the playbook ""how to write a space disaster movie"" and followed it play by play in particular the stereo-typical use of astronauts talking to their loved ones from outer space - putting on a brave show in the face of disaster - has been done time and time again<br /><br />max q appears to have been written in the hope that the producers would throw $50 million at the project but judging by the latter half of the film which contained numerous lame attempts at special effects the producers could only muster $50 thousand to learn that the film was nominated for a ""special visual effects"" emmy has me absolutely gob-smacked<br /><br />i think a handful of high school students with a pass in media studies could have created more believable effects<br /><br />and the plot holes are too numerous to mention but i will pick one out as an example now i'm no nasa expert but surely it's highly implausible that a worker attached to the shuttle simulator would suddenly hold a position of power in the control room when things start to go pear-shaped with the program surely there is someone more experienced at mission control who the program director would call on rather than a twenty-nine year old who has not been in the control room before<br /><br />the only saving grace for this film is the work of bill campbell he manages to make a good attempt at salvaging something out of the train wreck that is this script<br /><br />i give this film 2 out of 10 with the above-average work of bill campbell in the lead role saving it from a lower mark","['film', 'laboured', 'predictable', 'story', 'lines', 'shallow', 'characters', 'seen', 'writer', 'obviously', 'bought', 'playbook', 'write', 'space', 'disaster', 'movie', 'followed', 'play', 'play', 'particular', 'stereo', 'typical', 'use', 'astronauts', 'talking', 'loved', 'ones', 'outer', 'space', 'putting', 'brave', 'face', 'disaster', 'time', 'time', 'br', 'q', 'appears', 'written', 'hope', 'producers', 'throw', 'million', 'project', 'judging', 'half', 'film', 'contained', 'numerous', 'lame', 'attempts', 'special', 'effects', 'producers', 'muster', 'thousand', 'learn', 'film', 'nominated', 'special', 'visual', 'effects', 'emmy', 'absolutely', 'gob', 'smacked', 'br', 'think', 'handful', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'pass', 'media', 'studies', 'created', 'believable', 'effects', 'br', 'plot', 'holes', 'numerous', 'mention', 'pick', 'example', 'nasa', 'expert', 'surely', 'highly', 'implausible', 'worker', 'attached', 'shuttle', 'simulator', 'suddenly', 'hold', 'position', 'power', 'control', 'room', 'things', 'start', 'pear', 'shaped', 'program', 'surely', 'experienced', 'mission', 'control', 'program', 'director', 'year', 'old', 'control', 'room', 'br', 'saving', 'grace', 'film', 'work', 'bill', 'campbell', 'manages', 'good', 'attempt', 'salvaging', 'train', 'wreck', 'script', 'br', 'film', 'average', 'work', 'bill', 'campbell', 'lead', 'role', 'saving', 'lower', 'mark']","['film', 'labour', 'predictable', 'story', 'line', 'shallow', 'character', 'see', 'writer', 'obviously', 'buy', 'playbook', 'write', 'space', 'disaster', 'movie', 'follow', 'play', 'play', 'particular', 'stereo', 'typical', 'use', 'astronaut', 'talk', 'love', 'one', 'outer', 'space', 'put', 'brave', 'face', 'disaster', 'time', 'time', 'br', 'q', 'appear', 'write', 'hope', 'producer', 'throw', 'million', 'project', 'judge', 'half', 'film', 'contain', 'numerous', 'lame', 'attempt', 'special', 'effect', 'producer', 'muster', 'thousand', 'learn', 'film', 'nominate', 'special', 'visual', 'effect', 'emmy', 'absolutely', 'gob', 'smack', 'br', 'think', 'handful', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'pass', 'medium', 'study', 'create', 'believable', 'effect', 'br', 'plot', 'hole', 'numerous', 'mention', 'pick', 'example', 'nasa', 'expert', 'surely', 'highly', 'implausible', 'worker', 'attach', 'shuttle', 'simulator', 'suddenly', 'hold', 'position', 'power', 'control', 'room', 'thing', 'start', 'pear', 'shape', 'program', 'surely', 'experienced', 'mission', 'control', 'program', 'director', 'year', 'old', 'control', 'room', 'br', 'save', 'grace', 'film', 'work', 'bill', 'campbell', 'manage', 'good', 'attempt', 'salvage', 'train', 'wreck', 'script', 'br', 'film', 'average', 'work', 'bill', 'campbell', 'lead', 'role', 'save', 'low', 'mark']"
"Caddyshack Two is a good movie by itself but compared to the original it cant stack up. Robert Stack is a horrible replacement for Ted Knight and Jackie Mason, while funny just cant compete with Rodney Dangerfield. Ty Webb is funny, being the only character from the original. Most of the other characters in the movie lack the punch of the original (Henry Wilcoxon for example) except for the hystericly funny lawyer Peter Blunt, being played by Randy Quaid. Every line he says reminds me of the originals humor, especially the scene at his office (I don't go in for law suits or motions. I find out where you live and come to your house and beat down your door with a f***ing baseball bat, make a bonfire with the chippindale,maybe roast that golden retriever (arff arff arff) then eat it.

"Honestly - this short film sucks. the dummy used in the necro scene is pretty well made but still phony enough looking to ruin the viewing experience. the Unearthed DVD is crisp and clear and I haven't made up my mind if this helps or hinders it. If the film was a little grainy it might have added some ""creepiness factor"" to what was going on. I have no idea why this film has so much hype surrounding it other than the subject matter - but to be honest the necrophilia scenes in films like NEKROMANTIK and VISITOR Q among others, are more shocking than in AFTERMATH. All this talk about the film being about loneliness and all other manner of deep philosophy is bull****. This is an expensive, beautifully filmed turd. It's not that shocking, it's not that disgusting. if you insist on viewing it - rent it. I give it a 3 for the fact that not many people make explicit movies about necrophilia (there should definitely be a bigger selection for us sickos ;) - the filming is good and it does have some ""gore"" (if watching a rubbery looking doll get cut open is considered gore...) but other than that - absolutely nothing going for this over-hyped mess. On the other hand - GENESIS - Cerda's ""sequel"" to AFTERMATH (now available as a ""double feature"" released by Unearthed films) is an absolute masterpiece of a short film, really showing what a good director Cerda really is when given the right material. Although I don't care for AFTERMATH at all, GENESIS is so well made that I will forgive Cerda and Definitely keep an eye out for him in the future...","honestly - this short film sucks the dummy used in the necro scene is pretty well made but still phony enough looking to ruin the viewing experience the unearthed dvd is crisp and clear and i haven't made up my mind if this helps or hinders it if the film was a little grainy it might have added some ""creepiness factor"" to what was going on i have no idea why this film has so much hype surrounding it other than the subject matter - but to be honest the necrophilia scenes in films like nekromantik and visitor q among others are more shocking than in aftermath all this talk about the film being about loneliness and all other manner of deep philosophy is bull**** this is an expensive beautifully filmed turd it's not that shocking it's not that disgusting if you insist on viewing it - rent it i give it a 3 for the fact that not many people make explicit movies about necrophilia (there should definitely be a bigger selection for us sickos ;) - the filming is good and it does have some ""gore"" (if watching a rubbery looking doll get cut open is considered gore) but other than that - absolutely nothing going for this over-hyped mess on the other hand - genesis - cerda's ""sequel"" to aftermath (now available as a ""double feature"" released by unearthed films) is an absolute masterpiece of a short film really showing what a good director cerda really is when given the right material although i don't care for aftermath at all genesis is so well made that i will forgive cerda and definitely keep an eye out for him in the future","['honestly', 'short', 'film', 'sucks', 'dummy', 'necro', 'scene', 'pretty', 'phony', 'looking', 'ruin', 'viewing', 'experience', 'unearthed', 'dvd', 'crisp', 'clear', 'mind', 'helps', 'hinders', 'film', 'little', 'grainy', 'added', 'creepiness', 'factor', 'going', 'idea', 'film', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'subject', 'matter', 'honest', 'necrophilia', 'scenes', 'films', 'like', 'nekromantik', 'visitor', 'q', 'shocking', 'aftermath', 'talk', 'film', 'loneliness', 'manner', 'deep', 'philosophy', 'bull', 'expensive', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'turd', 'shocking', 'disgusting', 'insist', 'viewing', 'rent', 'fact', 'people', 'explicit', 'movies', 'necrophilia', 'definitely', 'bigger', 'selection', 'sickos', 'filming', 'good', 'gore', 'watching', 'rubbery', 'looking', 'doll', 'cut', 'open', 'considered', 'gore', 'absolutely', 'going', 'hyped', 'mess', 'hand', 'genesis', 'cerda', 'sequel', 'aftermath', 'available', 'double', 'feature', 'released', 'unearthed', 'films', 'absolute', 'masterpiece', 'short', 'film', 'showing', 'good', 'director', 'cerda', 'given', 'right', 'material', 'care', 'aftermath', 'genesis', 'forgive', 'cerda', 'definitely', 'eye', 'future']","['honestly', 'short', 'film', 'suck', 'dummy', 'necro', 'scene', 'pretty', 'phony', 'look', 'ruin', 'view', 'experience', 'unearthed', 'dvd', 'crisp', 'clear', 'mind', 'help', 'hinder', 'film', 'little', 'grainy', 'add', 'creepiness', 'factor', 'go', 'idea', 'film', 'hype', 'surround', 'subject', 'matter', 'honest', 'necrophilia', 'scene', 'film', 'like', 'nekromantik', 'visitor', 'q', 'shocking', 'aftermath', 'talk', 'film', 'loneliness', 'manner', 'deep', 'philosophy', 'bull', 'expensive', 'beautifully', 'film', 'turd', 'shock', 'disgusting', 'insist', 'view', 'rent', 'fact', 'people', 'explicit', 'movie', 'necrophilia', 'definitely', 'big', 'selection', 'sickos', 'filming', 'good', 'gore', 'watch', 'rubbery', 'look', 'doll', 'cut', 'open', 'consider', 'gore', 'absolutely', 'go', 'hype', 'mess', 'hand', 'genesis', 'cerda', 'sequel', 'aftermath', 'available', 'double', 'feature', 'release', 'unearth', 'film', 'absolute', 'masterpiece', 'short', 'film', 'show', 'good', 'director', 'cerda', 'give', 'right', 'material', 'care', 'aftermath', 'genesis', 'forgive', 'cerda', 'definitely', 'eye', 'future']"
"I thought that Mukhsin has been wonderfully written. Its not just about entertainment. There's tonnes of subtle messages that i think Yasmin was trying to bring across. And yes, it might be confusing to some of you(especially if you didn't watch Sepet and/or Gubra for 76 times).<br /><br />I bet u noticed how they use characters from the two movies before right? Its really ironic how the characters relate. Like the bossy neighbour is that prostitute from Gubra. And the chick at the snooker pad turns out to be the religious and wife of the pious man in the future. <br /><br />And i absolutely love the voice-overs. Its crude yet awakeningly fresh. Like, when they took a shot of the Rumah Tumpangan Gamin signboard, then there was suddenly Mukhsin's voice saying 'Bismillahhirrahmannirrahim..' (the scene when he climbed the tree).<br /><br />It captured Malaysian's attitude(and in some mild way, sniggering at how pathetic it is) portrayed in the character. For example, even the kids can be really sharp tongued(complete with the shrill annoying voice) and simply bad mouth ppl all movie long. And how you can be such a busybody and talk about ppl, when ur own life isn't sorted out. <br /><br />All i can say is, this movie totally reached my expectation if not exceeded it. <br /><br />It kept me glued to the screen, i couldn't even take my eyes off it.

"Upon viewing Tobe Hooper's gem, Crocodile, in 2000, I developed a great interest in the college/crocodile niche of the exploitation/monster genre. I look forward to a wayward producer to follow up with several sequels to these delightful bonbons of camp goodness. If only Ed Wood could bring his subtle sense of flair and dignity to these remarkable scripts. With Ed writing the scripts, and a room full of monkees creating crocodile special effects on a computer, all we'd need would be a cast of crocky fodder with Russ Meyer breasts and Ren Hoek pectoral implants.<br /><br />While Tobe Hooper's crocky opus referenced his own movies, Blood Surf chose to dish out a bunch of aging themes from the chum bucket of other movies. See if you can look past the Revenge of the Nerds sequel sets to find the allusions/homages?/rip-offs to Jaws, Temple of Doom, Indiana Jones' Last Crusade, The Convent, Godzilla 2000, and any James Bond movie.

"It tries to be the epic adventure of the century. And with a cast like Shô Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies it really is the perfect B-adventure of all time. It's actually is a pretty fun, swashbuckling adventure that, even with it's flaws, captures your interest. It must have felt as the biggest movie ever for the people who made it. Even if it's made in the 90s, it doesn't have a modern feel. It more has the same feeling that a old Errol Flynn movie had. Big adventure movie are again the big thing in Hollywood but I'm afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies had. This on the other hand, just has the real feeling.

"The Last Hard Men finds James Coburn an outlaw doing a long sentence breaking free from a chain gang. Do he and his friends head for the Mexican border from jail and safety. No they don't because Coburn has a mission of revenge. To kill the peace officer who brought him in and in the process killed his woman.<br /><br />That peace officer is Charlton Heston who is now retired and he knows what Coburn is after. As he explains it to his daughter, Barbara Hershey, Coburn was holed up in a shack and was involved in a Waco like standoff. His Indian woman was killed in the hail of bullets fired. It's not something he's proud of, she was a collateral casualty in a manhunt.<br /><br />Lest we feel sorry for Coburn he lets us know full well what an evil man he truly is. Heston is his usual stalwart hero, but the acting honors in The Last Hard Men go to James Coburn. He blows everyone else off the screen when he's on. <br /><br />Coburn gets the bright idea of making sure Heston trails him by kidnapping Hershey and taking her to an Indian reservation where the white authorities can't touch him. He knows that Heston has to make it personal then.<br /><br />Coburn's gang includes, Morgan Paull, Thalmus Rasulala, John Quade, Larry Wilcox, and Jorge Rivero. Heston has Chris Mitchum along who is his son-in-law to be.<br /><br />The Last Hard Men is one nasty and brutal western. Andrew McLaglen directed it and I'm thinking it may have been a project originally intended for Sam Peckinpaugh. It sure shows a lot of his influence with the liberal use of slow motion to accentuate the violence.

"Maybe it was the title, or the trailer (certainly not the interview on the DVD, which is with the director as he keeps saying ""hi, kids"" into the camera like a buffoon), but I had expectations for Entrails of a Virgin to be at least a bit of sleazy fun with some good sex scenes and brutal, bloody killings by a weird Japanese penetrator. Turns out it's way too sleazy for its own good, or bad, or whatever. There's a problem- and one can see this also in the Italian sexploitation flick Porno Holocaust, similar to this in many respects- in not having balance to the sex and violence. Too much sex and it will turn into a prototypical porno, and not even with much production quality in comparison with most professional porno movies! And with the killing scenes, there has to be at least a little tack, and maybe just a smidgen of ingenuity, in creating the creature/killer/whatever. Entrails of a Virgin has neither. It's safe to say it's a pretty soulless movie, even if isn't one of the very worst ever made- it's there just for horn-dog Japanese fetishists to get off on girls in trouble and men who have all their brains in their 'other' heads.<br /><br />In this case, we're given a photo team where the guys are taking some shots of some girls, nothing too salacious, and then by way of a dense fog they stay off at some house one night and are picked off one by one by ""A Murderer"" as he's credited. First off, the director Kazuo 'Gaira' Komizu decides he has to put in a quota of random sex scenes early on- we get spliced in (or phoned in, take your pick) clips of one of the photographers having sex with one or more of the girls elsewhere. It looks like it's from another movie. Then once settled into the house, there's a 'wrestling' scene that's poorly choreographed and shot (yeah, we really need to see him 'all' there), and then on to the rape and killings. First the rape, by the photographers, who promise the girls some jobs for their time. Then the Murderer, who like D'Amato's creature is simply covered in mud and given a stupid facial, and who for an unknown reason kills the men and/or rapes the women one by one.<br /><br />Now, the latter of those, taken by themselves, should be considered the highlights of the movie. This is like saying, however, that the croûtons are the best part of a wretchedly tasting salad. An eye-gouging scene, a spike thrown like an Olympic event (that scene, actually, is kind of cool), and finally the entrailing of the overly sex-crazed girl, whose inconsequential name I can't remember. Even *this* becomes disappointing just by not being correct to the title! On top of this, the sex scenes, which become tedious through 'Gaira' and his indulgence in long-takes-without-cutaways where everything by the Japanese censors is blurred anyway, are dubbed over by the actors (you'd think that they seem to be enjoying themselves enough, hence the need to let them 'speak' for themselves). But the overall feeling from Entrails of a Virgin is that of a lumpy one, where it's just there to be gawked at and without a shred of suspense or true horror (watch as the last girl left alive, the virgin of the picture, tries to stop the murderer from getting to her, which lasts five minutes as she keeps throwing sticks at him!) You just want it to be done with, for the 'I hate women' mantra to ease up or be rid altogether.","maybe it was the title or the trailer (certainly not the interview on the dvd which is with the

"The few scenes that actually attempt a depiction of revolutionary struggle resemble a hirsute Boy Scout troop meandering tentatively between swimming holes. When Sharif or, please God, Palance try their hand at fiery oratory, they sound like Kurtz swallowing a bug. The displays of strategic brilliance incorporate a map of Cuba replete with smiling fishies in the ocean, and a positively Vaudevillian hypothesis on how the Bay of Pigs came to pass.

"This film took me by surprise. I make it a habit of finding out as little as possible about films before attending because trailers and reviews provide spoiler after spoiler. All I knew upon entering the theater is that it was a documentary about a long married couple and that IMDb readers gave it a 7.8, Rotten Tomatoes users ranked it at 7.9 and the critics averaged an amazing 8.2! If anything, they UNDERRATED this little gem.<br /><br />Filmmaker Doug Block decided to record his parents ""for posterity"" and at the beginning of the film we are treated to the requisite interviews with his parents, outspoken mother Mina, and less than forthcoming dad, Mike. I immediately found this couple interesting and had no idea where the filmmaker (Mike & Mina's son Doug) was going to take us. As a matter of fact, I doubt that Doug himself knew where he was going with this!<br /><br />Life takes unexpected twists and turns and this beautifully expressive film follows the journey. It is difficult to verbalize just how moved I was with this story and the unique way in which it was told. Absolutely riveting from beginning to end and it really is a must-see even if you aren't a fan of the documentary genre. This film will make you think of your own life and might even evoke memories that you thought were long forgotten. ""51 Birch Street"" is one of those rare filmgoing experiences that makes a deep impression and never leaves you. The best news of all is that HBO had a hand in the production so instead of playing to a limited art house audience, eventually, millions of people will have a chance to view this incredible piece of work.

"Stephen Hawkings is a genius. He is the king of geniuses. Watching this movie makes me feel dumb. But it's a great movie. Not highly entertaining, but very very intriguing. The movie centers around wheelchair bound Stephen Hawkings, a man who makes Einstein look average, and his theories and scientific discoveries about the universe, time, the galaxy, and black holes. Everyone at sometime or another during a really intense high comes to a moment when they think they'v got the universe and the cosmos figured out and they swear as soon as they sober up they'll write it all down. Well here is a man who actually held that feeling for more then six hours. Here is a man who despite suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease has become the greatest mind the world has yet seen.

"Oh God, I must have seen this when I was only 11 or twelve, (don't ask how) I may have been young, but I wasn't stupid. Anyone could see that this is a bad movie, nasty, gross, unscary and very silly. I've seen more impressive effects at Disneyland, I've seen better performances at a school play, And I've seen more convincing crocodiles at the zoo, where they do nothing but sit in the water, ignoring the children tapping on the glass.<br /><br />The story is set in northern Australia. A handful of ambitious young people, are trying out a new water sport, surfing in shark filled waters. It soon becomes evident that something more dangerous is in the water. After they learn what, they get the help of a grizzly middle aged fisherman, who wants to kill the animal to avenge the eating of his family.<br /><br />I think I have seen every crocodile film made in the last fifteen years, the best of which is Lake Placid, and the worse of which is its sequel. Blood Surf would have to be the second worst croc flick I think, with Primeval and Crocodile tailing closely behind.<br /><br />The Australian Saltwater Crododile is one of the most dangerous creatures out there, resulting in more than a hundred injuries or deaths every year. Movies like Blood Surf however ruin not only the ferocious image of such a creature, but a good hour and a half of the viewer's life.

"""Fate"" leads Walter Sparrow to come in possession of a mysterious novel that has eerie similarities and connections to his life, all based around the number 23. As the story unfolds in real life and fiction, Sparrow must figure out his connection to the book and how the story will eventually end.<br /><br />The Number 23 offers an intriguing premise that is undone by a weak execution. The film just failed on many different levels which is pretty disappointing because it held so much potential. The screenplay was probably the worst part about it. It was filled with silly sequences and laughable dialog that just killed the mood of the movie. It seemed like the screenwriter had a good idea, he just didn't know how to develop it to stretch over a ninety minute running time. The second half of the film was running low on ideas, the twist was pretty obvious and the ending was awful.<br /><br />Joel Schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movies ever and he did redeem himself a little with Phone Booth and a few other films but The Number 23 reminds me that he's still capable of making a stinker. He has the movie drenched in style but he just can't get a good focus. He moves the film at a clunky and slow pace. He switches from reality to what's actually happening in the book which quickly got annoying. The actual book in the film that's titled ""The Number 23"" is an awful detective story and the audience gets stuck listening to Carrey narrate it which just bored me to tears. When Carrey is finally done with book, we get stuck watching him run around trying to solve the mystery. At this point, the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension. We impatiently wait for the movie to reach it's horrible ending and unconvincing explanation before celebrating that film has finally finished.<br /><br />The acting was mostly average and pretty forgettable. Jim Carrey was clearly just sleepwalking through his performance and he didn't even seem to be trying. He was either completely over the top in some scenes or just very wooden. His narration was a complete bore to listen to and he put no life inside his character. Virginia Madsen did the best she could with a limited role but she needs to pick better scripts. Logan Lerman was pretty bland as was Danny Huston. Overall, The Number 23 was an awful thriller that offered more laughs than suspense or thrills.

This was probably the worst movie i have ever seen in my life!! It was stupid there was no plot and the special affects were ridiculous!! And i have never seen such bad acting in my life! The only good part about the movie were all the hot guys(especially Drew Fuller). I don't know what these people were thinking when they made this movie!! I didn't even want to finish the whole thing because you get to this point in the movie where the guys are all in bed touching themselves. I mean it was like some kind of sick and twisted kiddy porn!

The whole movie was a complete waste of time in my opinion.,this was probably the worst movie i have ever seen in my life it was stupid there was no plot and the special affects were ridiculous and i have never seen such bad acting in my life the only good part about the movie were all the hot guys(especially drew fuller) i don't know what these people were thinking when they made this movie i didn't even want to finish the whole thing because you get to this point in the movie where the guys are all in bed touching themselves i mean it was like some kind of sick and twisted kiddy porn i would advise anyone who has heard of this movie and was interested in seeing it to just forget about it and find another movie to watch i was very disappointed the whole movie was a complete waste of time in my opinion,"['probably', 'worst', 'movie', 'seen', 'life', 'stupid', 'plot', 'special', 'affects', 'ridiculous', 'seen', 'bad', 'acting', 'life', 'good', 'movie', 'hot', 'drew', 'fuller', 'know', 'people', 'thinking', 'movie', 'want', 'finish', 'thing', 'point', 'movie', 'guys', 'bed', 'touching', 'mean', 'like', 'kind', 'sick', 'twisted', 'kiddy', 'porn', 'advise', 'heard', 'movie', 'interested', 'seeing', 'forget', 'find', 'movie', 'watch', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'opinion']","['probably', 'bad', 'movie', 'see', 'life', 'stupid', 'plot', 'special', 'affect', 'ridiculous', 'see', 'bad', 'act', 'life', 'good', 'movie', 'hot', 'draw', 'full', 'know', 'people', 'think', 'movie', 'want', 'finish', 'thing', 'point', 'movie', 'guy', 'bed', 'touch', 'mean', 'like', 'kind', 'sick', 'twisted', 'kiddy', 'porn', 'advise', 'hear', 'movie', 'interested', 'see', 'forget', 'find', 'movie', 'watch', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'opinion']"
"This is a typical Steele novel production in that two people who have undergone some sort of tragedy manage to get together despite the odds. I wouldn't call this a spoiler because anyone who has read a Steele novel knows how they ALL end. If you don't want to know much about the plot, don't keep reading.<br /><br />Gilbert's character, Ophelia, is a woman of French decent who has lost her husband and son in an accident. Gilbert needs to stop doing films where she is required to have an accent because she, otherwise a good actress, cannot realistically pull off any kind of accent. Brad Johnson, also an excellent actor, is Matt, who is recovering from a rather nasty divorce. He is gentle, convincing and compelling in this role.<br /><br />The two meet on the beach through her daughter, Pip, and initially, Ophelia accuses Matt of being a child molester just because he talked art with the kid. All of them become friends after this episode and then the couple falls in love.<br /><br />The chemistry between the two leads is not great, even though the talent of these two people is not, in my opinion, a question. They did the best they could with a predictable plot and a script that borders on stereotypical. Two people meet, tragedy, bigger tragedy, a secret is revealed, another tragedy, and then they get together. I wish there was more to it than that, but there it is in a nutshell.<br /><br />I wanted mindless entertainment, and I got it with this. In regard to the genre of romantic films, this one fails to be memorable. ""A Secret Affair"" with Janine Turner is far superior (not a Steele book), as are some of Steele's earlier books turned into film.","this is a typical steele novel production in that two people who have undergone some sort of tragedy manage to get together despite the odds i wouldn't call this a spoiler because anyone who has read a steele novel knows how they all end if you don't want to know much about the plot don't keep reading<br /><br />gilbert's character ophelia is a woman of french decent who has lost her husband and son in an accident gilbert needs to stop doing films where she is required to have an accent because she otherwise a good actress cannot realistically pull off any kind of accent brad johnson also an excellent actor is matt who is recovering from a rather nasty divorce he is gentle convincing and compelling in this role<br /><br />the two meet on the beach through her daughter pip and initially ophelia accuses matt of being a child molester just because he talked art with the kid all of them become friends after this episode and then the couple falls in love<br /><br />the chemistry between the two leads is not great even though the talent of these two people is not in my opinion a question they did the best they could with a predictable plot and a script that borders on stereotypical two people meet tragedy bigger tragedy a secret is revealed another tragedy and then they get together i wish there was more to it than that but there it is in a nutshell<br /><br />i wanted mindless entertainment and i got it with this in regard to the genre of romantic films this one fails to be memorable ""a secret affair"" with janine turner is far superior (not a steele book) as are some of steele's earlier books turned into film","['typical', 'steele', 'novel', 'production', 'people', 'undergone', 'sort', 'tragedy', 'manage', 'despite', 'odds', 'spoiler', 'read', 'steele', 'novel', 'knows', 'end', 'want', 'know', 'plot', 'reading', 'br', 'character', 'ophelia', 'woman', 'french', 'decent', 'lost', 'husband', 'son', 'accident', 'gilbert', 'needs', 'stop', 'films', 'required', 'accent', 'good', 'actress', 'realistically', 'pull', 'kind', 'accent', 'brad', 'johnson', 'excellent', 'actor', 'matt', 'recovering', 'nasty', 'divorce', 'gentle', 'convincing', 'compelling', 'role', 'br', 'meet', 'beach', 'daughter', 'pip', 'initially', 'ophelia', 'accuses', 'matt', 'child', 'molester', 'talked', 'art', 'kid', 'friends', 'episode', 'couple', 'falls', 'love', 'br', 'chemistry', 'leads', 'great', 'talent', 'people', 'opinion', 'question', 'best', 'predictable', 'plot', 'script', 'borders', 'stereotypical', 'people', 'meet', 'tragedy', 'bigger', 'tragedy', 'secret', 'revealed', 'tragedy', 'wish', 'nutshell', 'br', 'wanted', 'mindless', 'entertainment', 'got', 'regard', 'genre', 'romantic', 'films', 'fails', 'memorable', 'secret', 'affair', 'janine', 'turner', 'far', 'superior', 'steele', 'book', 'steele', 'earlier', 'books', 'turned', 'film']","['typical', 'steele', 'novel', 'production', 'people', 'undergo', 'sort', 'tragedy', 'manage', 'despite', 'odd', 'spoiler', 'read', 'steele', 'novel', 'know', 'end', 'want', 'know', 'plot', 'read', 'br', 'character', 'ophelia', 'woman', 'french', 'decent', 'lose', 'husband', 'son', 'accident', 'gilbert', 'need', 'stop', 'film', 'require', 'accent', 'good', 'actress', 'realistically', 'pull', 'kind', 'accent', 'brad', 'johnson', 'excellent', 'actor', 'matt', 'recover', 'nasty', 'divorce', 'gentle', 'convincing', 'compelling', 'role', 'br', 'meet', 'beach', 'daughter', 'pip', 'initially', 'ophelia', 'accuse', 'matt', 'child', 'molester', 'talk', 'art', 'kid', 'friend', 'episode', 'couple', 'fall', 'love', 'br', 'chemistry', 'lead', 'great', 'talent', 'people', 'opinion', 'question', 'good', 'predictable', 'plot', 'script', 'border', 'stereotypical', 'people', 'meet', 'tragedy', 'big', 'tragedy', 'secret', 'reveal', 'tragedy', 'wish', 'nutshell', 'br', 'want', 'mindless', 'entertainment', 'get', 'regard', 'genre', 'romantic', 'film', 'fail', 'memorable', 'secret', 'affair', 'janine', 'turner', 'far', 'superior', 'steele', 'book', 'steele', 'early', 'book', 'turn', 'film']"

"Nicholas Walker is Paul, the local town Reverand who's married to Martha (Ally Sheedy), but also is a habitual womanizer and decides to fake his own death to run away with his current affair, Veronica (Dara Tomanovich). However in so doing, he gets a bout of amnesia (hence the name of the film). Sally Kirkland is also on hand as a crazy old coot who pines for the good Reverand in a shades of ""Misery"" type of way. It's sad to see a pretty good cast wasted like this. Not the least bit John Savage in a horridly forgettable role as a shoddy private investigator. In a film billed as a 'black comedy', one has to bring BOTH elements into said movie. While this does bring the former in spades, it sadly contains none of the latter. Furthermore you can't emphasize with any of the characters and as thus, have absolutely no vested interest in them.

"Hollywood movie industry is the laziest one in the entire world. It only needs a single hit to flood theaters with the same old crap re-invented over and over again. Take superheroes for example, for each X-Man and Spiderman, there are Daredevil, Elektra, Ghost Rider and Hulk. Japanese horror remakes are even worst. It only took The Ring, which was pitch-perfect (mostly because of Mr. Gore Verbinsky), to bring a ton of look-alike creepy-woman based horrors, e.g. The Ring 2, The Eye, Dark Water (which was fine, but pointless), and the grudges.<br /><br />The first Grudge wasn't entirely bad. It was scary most of the way, which is what one could expect from it. Plus, the plot had some brains mixing narratives. Grudge 2 is exactly like the previous; this could be a good thing, but hey, what boy Men in Black II? Was it a nice thing to xerox the entire screenplay and just change the villain? For the Grudge 2, the critic goes the same way.<br /><br />Tired scares, bad acting (except for Amber Tamblyn), and clichés all over the place. Three stories take place, on different places and time. There is Aubrey (Tamblyn) investigating what drove her sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) to death; Allison (Arielle Kebbel) who is taken by colleagues to visit the house where the incident depicted in the first movie took place; and finally, an American family that witness strange stuff happening on the apartment next door. Glad to say (and I mean it) that everything is tied up at the end, but one must not rely on the end to make a good picture, when everything else is simply tiresome and dull.<br /><br />The chills are all over there, a girl alone in the lockers, someone who shouldn't enter a house, others that dig too deep. Meanwhile, ghosts keep killing and killing and killing, which seems even more deadlier than ten world wars or the Ebola epidemic.

"Deanna Durbin, Nan Grey and Barbara Read are ""Three Smart Girls"" in this Universal film from 1936, which introduces Deanna Durbin to film audiences. It also stars Ray Milland, Mischa Auer, Charles Winninger, John King, Binnie Barnes and Alice Brady. It's a sweet story about three young women, now living in Switzerland with their divorced mother, who hear their father (Winninger) is marrying again. Not having seen him in 10 years and knowing their mother still loves him, they board a ship to America, with the help of the housekeeper/nanny, determined to stop the wedding. Realizing that the intended, called ""Precious"" (Barnes) is nothing but a gold-digger aided and abetted by her mother (Brady), they arrange for her to be introduced to a wealthy Count. This is arranged by their father's accountant (King). The man he chooses is a full-time drunk (Auer), but the girls mistake him for an actual wealthy count (Milland). What a mess.<br /><br />This is a delightful film, not cloying or overly sugary at all, with some nice performances, particularly by Auer, Milland, Barnes and Brady. The young women are pretty and all do good work. The emphasis, of course, is on young Durbin, who is a natural actress and a beautifully-trained singer. In fact, her voice as a youngster is much more even than it would be as an adult - she has no trouble with the high notes, as she did later on because she put too much weight in the middle voice. She sings a delightful ""Il Bacio"" in a police station.<br /><br />One of the nicest things about the film is to see the father, played by Charles Winninger, not want his children around - until he sees them and gets to know them. Barnes as the gold-digger isn't all that young, but the girls' mother looks way up there, so the inference probably was the older man seeking his youth with a younger, more glamorous woman. In fact, he finds the youth he was seeking in his daughters.<br /><br />Universal gives Durbin the big star buildup here - she has the final shot in the movie. Ray Milland at this point was still paying his dues, and it will probably be a surprise even to film fans how young and attractive he is.<br /><br />Very entertaining and of course, this led to a sequel and big stardom for Deanna.","deanna durbin nan grey and barbara read are ""three smart girls"" in this universal film from 1936 which introduces deanna durbin to film audiences it also stars ray milland mischa auer charles winninger john king binnie barnes and alice brady it's a sweet story about three young women now living in switzerland with their divorced mother who hear their father (winninger) is marrying again not having seen him in 10 years and knowing their mother still loves him they board a ship to america with the help of the housekeeper/nanny determined to stop the wedding realizing that the intended called ""precious"" (barnes) is nothing but a gold-digger aided and abetted by her mother (brady) they arrange for her to be introduced to a wealthy count this is arranged by their father's accountant (king) the man he chooses is a full-time drunk (auer) but the girls mistake him for an actual wealthy count (milland) what a mess<br /><br />this is a delightful film not cloying or overly sugary at all with some nice performances particularly by auer milland barnes and brady the young women are pretty and all do good work the emphasis of course is on young durbin who is a natural actress and a beautifully-trained singer in fact her voice as a youngster is much more even than it would be as an adult -

"If anyone is wondering why no one makes movies like they used to, with conversation, character and a simple theme of friendship struggling to evolve into something new, better and different, those folks need to take in this film and see top notch writing, directing, and acting that melds into a wonderful evening of observation on how things used to be in Italy and England. Other days, other times funneled into a terrific comedy of entertainment, made in 1992 with Alfred Molina, Joan Plowright, Polly Walker, Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent, Miranda Richardson, and Michael Kitchens in the major roles. Under the brush stroke direction of Mike Newell, these actors accomplish vividly memorable performances that are photographed with a sublimely subtle painter's eye. Reminiscent of the theatrical bedroom farce of the turn of the century, this film might be called a friendship farce that becomes a worthwhile experience in the growth of the romantic nature within each character, and the viewer, too.

"Daniel Day-Lewis is the most versatile actor alive. English aristocratic snob in A Room With a View, passionate Irish thief in In the Name of the Father, an impudent, violent butcher in Gangs of New York (in a performance ten times stronger than Adrian Brody's in the Pianist) and as the outrageous Cristy Brown with cerebral palsy in My Left Foot (just to name a few). His roles all influence eachother, but each is seperate, and utterly unique. He changes completely, with each character he takes on. And I'm beginning to believe that he can act as anything. Anything.<br /><br />As Cristy Brown he is stunning. He does not ridicule the character, and he does not pity the character. A difficult achievement. And Cristy Brown comes to life. A smart man. An outrageous man. Human.<br /><br />This movie, despite small scene-transition faults and the like, is an inspiration. Yes, it's predictable. But is it stupidly sentimental? No. I laughed. I cried. Not a single moment of cheese. Proof that this isn't a Hollywood movie.<br /><br />My favourite scene is the scene in the restaurant, when Cristy is discussing painters with Eileen, Peter and her friends. Here's where Daniel Day-Lewis reaches an acting climax. ""I'll kick you in the only part of your anatomy that's animated."" ""Wheel out the cripple!"" And his performance never slows down, never falters, and is beautiful. Simply. He has a lot of screen time here. I watch it again again, and I never get tired of Cristy's perspicacious eyes, twitching and guttural speeches.<br /><br />A must-see.

"My guess would be this was originally going to be at least two parts, and thus at least a quarter longer, because otherwise how can one explain its confused, abbreviated storyline. I was never completely lost, but I was often partially lost and usually unclear on character motivation. The movie feels as though joining plot points were dropped to squeeze it into its time slot.<br /><br />If it were longer, it might make more sense, but it still wouldn't be much good. The movie's most interesting idea is of the war between Zeus and Hera as being a war between the male and female, but the movie drops the ball on this, making Hera's followers fairly horrible while not being clear on what Zeus' followers do or believe. The movie is also interesting because you don't see the gods and there's no real certainty that they exist.

"I have been a Mario fan for as long as I can remember, I have very fond memories of playing Super Mario World as a kid, this game has brought back many of those memories while adding something new. Super Mario Galaxy is the latest installment in the amazing Mario franchise. There is much very different about this game from any other Mario before it, while still keeping intact the greatest elements of Mario, the first noticeable difference is that the story takes place in space.<br /><br />The story begins much like any other Mario game, Mario receives a letter from Princess Peach inviting him to a celebration at her castle in the Mushroom Kingdom. Upon arriving at Peach's castle Mario finds Bowser and his son (Bowser Jr.) attacking the castle with their airships. Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach and then lifts her castle up into space. In the midst of the castle being lifted into space Mario falls off and lands on an unknown planet. Mario is found by a talking star named Luma and is taken back to the Luma's home, a floating space station, here Mario meets many other Lumas and also meets their leader, a woman named Rosalina. Rosalina tells Mario that Bowser has taken away the space station's Power Stars and scattered them across the universe, it is up to Mario to help the Lumas find them and save Peach, thus the adventure begins.<br /><br />The way you play the game is by flying from the space station to other galaxies, each galaxy consists of multiple planets that Mario travels amongst in levels via these shooting stars to retrieve the Power Stars. Mario can at many times walk all the way around planets without losing gravity, some planets are small and others are big, many planets are similar to classic Mario environments. The best thing about the game are the controls, all of the stuff like jumping and such is still the same, but the wiimote is used in many unique ways in this game. You shake the remote Mario will perform a spin that is used as the primary attack in the game, and it will as well activate the shooting stars. You can also point the remote at the screen and use the pointer to fire star bits at enemies or objects in the environment. Then there is the graphics, these are by far the best graphics on the Wii, it is just so hard to describe how great this game looks, you could probably almost say it looks as good as some 360 games.<br /><br />My only minor gripes is that the going upside down effect takes some getting used to, and also the story is pretty weak. The worst part is that you lose all of your lives when you turn off the game, no matter how many you had when you last quit you restart at 4 lives. Still these minor problems aside it's a superb game that is highly entertaining and is very challenging. This is the type of game that we've been waiting for on the Wii.<br /><br />A perfect 10 out of 10!",i have been a mario fan for as long as i can remember i have very fond memories of playing super

"This short film that inspired the soon-to-be full length feature - Spatula Madness - is a hilarious piece that contends against similar cartoons yielding multiple writers. The short film stars Edward the Spatula who after being fired from his job, joins in the fight against the evil spoons. This premise allows for some funny content near the beginning, but is barely present for the remainder of the feature. This film's 15-minute running time is absorbed by some odd-ball comedy and a small musical number. Unfortunately not much else lies below it. The plot that is set up doesn't really have time to show. But it's surely follows it plot better than many high-budget Hollywood films. This film is worth watching at least a few times. Take it for what it is, and don't expect a deep story.",this short film that inspired the soon-to-be full length feature - spatula madness - is a hilarious piece that contends against similar cartoons yielding multiple writers the short film stars edward the spatula who after being fired from his job joins in the fight against the evil spoons this premise allows for some funny content near the beginning but is barely present for the remainder of the feature this film's 15-minute running time is absorbed by some odd-ball comedy and a small musical number unfortunately not much else lies below it the plot that is set up doesn't really have time to show but it's surely follows it plot better than many high-budget hollywood films this film is worth watching at least a few times take it for what it is and don't expect a deep story,"['short', 'film', 'inspired', 'soon', 'length', 'feature', 'spatula', 'madness', 'hilarious', 'piece', 'contends', 'similar', 'cartoons', 'yielding', 'multiple', 'writers', 'short', 'film', 'stars', 'edward', 'spatula', 'fired', 'job', 'joins', 'fight', 'evil', 'spoons', 'premise', 'allows', 'funny', 'content', 'near', 'beginning', 'barely', 'present', 'remainder', 'feature', 'film', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'absorbed', 'odd', 'ball', 'comedy', 'small', 'musical', 'number', 'unfortunately', 'lies', 'plot', 'set', 'time', 'surely', 'follows', 'plot', 'better', 'high', 'budget', 'hollywood', 'films', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'times', 'expect', 'deep', 'story']","['short', 'film', 'inspire', 'soon', 'length', 'feature', 'spatula', 'madness', 'hilarious', 'piece', 'contend', 'similar', 'cartoon', 'yield', 'multiple', 'writer', 'short', 'film', 'star', 'edward', 'spatula', 'fire', 'job', 'join', 'fight', 'evil', 'spoon', 'premise', 'allow', 'funny', 'content', 'near', 'beginning', 'barely', 'present', 'remainder', 'feature', 'film', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'absorb', 'odd', 'ball', 'comedy', 'small', 'musical', 'number', 'unfortunately', 'lie', 'plot', 'set', 'time', 'surely', 'follow', 'plot', 'well', 'high', 'budget', 'hollywood', 'film', 'film', 'worth', 'watch', 'time', 'expect', 'deep', 'story']"
"Okay, last night, August 18th, 2004, I had the distinct displeasure of meeting Mr. Van Bebble at a showing of the film The Manson Family at the Three Penny in Chicago as part of the Chicago Underground Film Festival. Here's what I have to say about it. First of all, the film is an obvious rip off of every Kenneth Anger, Roman Polanski, Oliver Stone and Terry Gilliam movie I've ever seen. Second of all, in a short Q & A session after the show Mr. Van Bebble immediately stated that he never made any contact with the actual Manson Family members or Charlie himself, calling them liars and saying he wanted nothing to do with them, that the film was based on his (Van Bebble's) take on the trial having seen it all from his living room on TV and in the news (and I'm assuming from the Autobiography and the book Helter Skelter which were directly mimicked through the narrative). So I had second dibs on questions, I asked if he was trying to present the outsider, Mtv, sex drugs and rock 'n roll version and not necessarily the true story. This question obviously pissed off the by now sloshed director who started shouting ""f*** you, shut the f*** up, this is the truth! All those other movies are bullsh**!""<br /><br />Well anyway, I didn't even think about how ridiculous this was until the next day when I read the tagline for the film, ""You've heard the laws side of the story...now hear the story as it is told by the Manson Family."" Excuse me, if this guy has never even spoken to the family and considers them to be liars that he doesn't want to have anything to do with, how in God's name can he tell the story for them!? This is the most ridiculous statement I have ever heard! The film was obviously catered to the sex drugs and rock 'n roll audience that it had no trouble in attracting to the small, dimly lit theatre, and was even more obviously spawned by the sex drugs and rock 'n roll mind of a man who couldn't even watch his own film without getting up every ten minutes to go get more beer or to shout some sort of Rocky Horroresque call line to the actors on screen. This film accomplishes little more than warping the public's image of actual events (which helped shape the state of America and much of the world today) into some sort of Slasher/Comic Book/Porno/Rape fantasy dreamed up by an obviously shallow individual.<br /><br />The film was definitely very impressive to look at. The soundtrack was refreshing as it contained actual samples of Charlie's work with the Family off of his Lie album. The editing was nice and choppy to simulate the nauseating uncertainty of most modern music videos. All in all this film would have made a much better addition to the catalogues at Mtv than to the Underground Film Festival or for that matter the minds of any intellectual observers. I felt like I was at a midnight Rocky Horror viewing the way the audience was dressed and behaving (probably the best part of the experience). The cast was very good with the exception of Charlie who resembled some sort of stoned Dungeons and Dragons enthusiast more than the actual role he was portraying. The descriptions the film gave of him as full of energy, throwing ten things at you and being very physical about it all the while did not match at all the slow, lethargic, and chubby representation that was actually presented.<br /><br />All in all the film basically explains itself as Sadie (or maybe it was Linda) declares at the end, ""You can write a bunch of bullsh** books or make a bunch of bullsh** movies...etc. etc."" Case in point. Even the disclaimer ""Based on a True Story"" is a dead giveaway, signalling that somewhere beneath this psychedelic garbage heap lay the foundation of an actual story with content that will make and has made a difference in the world. All you have to do is a little bit of alchemy to separate the truth from the the crap, or actually, maybe you could just avoid it all together and go read a book instead.<br /><br />All I can say is this, when the film ended I got a free beer so I'm glad I went, but not so glad I spent fifteen dollars on my ticket to be told to shut the f*** up for asking the director a question.

"I bought this game on an impulse buy from walmart. I am glad I did. It was very entertaining listening to Sean Connery and playing the game. I thought the graphics were the best I have ever seen in a movie/game remake. The bonus levels were very hard! The sniper one I think was too hard, it made me so frustrated I didn't play the game for a week and a half. There were too many people shooting at you with nothing to hide behind or life to handle it. <br /><br />The only thing I might change was the upgrade system. I didn't notice any difference from un-upgraded equipment to the upgraded, such as buying an armor upgrade didn't seem to make the armor stronger or more filling on my life meter.

"No, this hilariously horrible 70's made-for-TV horror clinker isn't about a deadly demonically possessed dessert cake. Still, this exceptionally awful, yet undeniably amusing and thus enjoyable cathode ray refuse reaches a breathtaking apex of absolute, unremitting silliness and atrociousness that's quite tasty in a so-execrable-it's-downright-awesome sort of way. Richard Crenna, looking haggard and possibly inebriated, and Yvette Mimieux, who acts as if she never got over the brutal rape she endured in ""Jackson County Jail,"" sluggishly portray a disgustingly nice and respectable suburbanite couple whose quaint, dull, sleepy small town existence gets ripped asunder when the cute German Shepard they take in as the family pet turns out to be some ancient lethal evil spirit. Pretty soon Mimieux and her two repellently cutesy kids Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann (the psychic alien moppets from the Disney ""Witch Mountain"" pictures) are worshiping a crude crayon drawing of the nasty, ugly canine entity in the den. Boy, now doesn't that sound really scary and disturbing? Well, scary and disturbing this laughably ludicrous claptrap sure ain't, but it sure is funny, thanks to Curtis (""Night Tide"") Harrington's hopelessly weak direction, cartoonish (not so) special effects, an almost painfully risible'n'ridiculous plot, and a game cast that struggles valiantly with the absurd story (besides the leads, both Martine Beswicke and R.G. Armstrong briefly pop up as members of a Satanic cult and Victor Jory has a nice cameo as a helpful Native American shaman). Favorite scene: the malicious Mephestophelion mutt puts the whammy on Crenna, practically forcing him to stick his hand into a wildly spinning lawnmower blade. While stuck-up snobby fright film fans may hold their noses at the perfectly putrid stench of this admittedly smelly schlock, devout TV trash lovers should deem this endearingly abominable offal the

"Marion Davies stars in this remarkable comedy ""Show People"" released by MGM in 1928. Davies plays a hick from Savannah, Georgia, who arrives in Hollywood with her father (Dell Henderson). The jalopy they arrive in is a hoot - as is Davies outrageous southern costume. Davies lands a job in slapstick comedy, not what she wants, but it brings her success. She meets fellow slapstick star William Haines, who is immediately smitten with her. Well, Davies then gets a job at a more prestigious studio (""High Art Studios"") and lands a job in stuffy period pieces. A handsome but fake actor (Andre Telefair) shows her the ropes of how to be the typical pretentious Hollywood star. Davies abandons her slapstick friend and father for the good life, but of course learns that is not who she really is. Marion Davies is wonderful throughout, as she - outrageously - runs the gamut of emotions required of a ""serious"" actress. William Haines is his usual wonderful comedic self, and there are cameos by Charles Chaplin, John Gilbert, and other famous stars of the day, including the director of the film, King Vidor. This is a silent film with a few ""sound effects"" as sound pictures were just coming into their own.

"While Star Trek the Motion Picture was mostly boring, Star Trek The Final Frontier is plain bad. In this terrible sequel, the crew is on shore leave when they get a distress signal from the Federation that ambassadors representing Earth, Romulus and Kronos (the Klingon home world) have been kidnapped by a renegade Vulcan bent on his quest to attain a starship to venture into the great barrier. There, he hopes to find God. Using mysticism and bad writing, he persuades many of the senior officers of the Enterprise to betray Kirk and get a hold of the ship. They do reach the inside of the great barrier and find a planet where they do meet a god-like alien. This one is so bad it is hard to figure out where to begin. At the core is a good idea that is never really developed. The plot goes nowhere instead of where no man has gone before. It is almost like the writers had no idea how to end this fiasco. The action scenes don't have the suspense of Wrath of Kahn, the philosophy is boring, and the humor is stale. Now I will focus most of my anger on William Shatner. When he takes the director's chair, the ego gets bigger. Most of the focus is on him, Spock, and McCoy, but does not give the others enough to do. Moreover, whereas Shatner is usually guilty of over-acting in previous movies and television spots, he is just plain bad in this one. Now Kirk is reckless, a practical jokers, and silly. One of the worst scenes involves the three leaders singing the song, ""Row Row Row your Boat"" in a round by a campfire. In any case, this is the worst of the Star Trek franchise. I should have given it three out of ten instead of five.","while star trek the motion picture was mostly boring star trek the final frontier is plain bad in this terrible sequel the crew is on shore leave when they get a distress signal from the federation that ambassadors representing earth romulus and kronos (the klingon home world) have been kidnapped by a renegade vulcan bent on his quest to attain a starship to venture into the great barrier there he hopes to find god using mysticism and bad writing he persuades many of the senior officers of the enterprise to betray kirk and get a hold of the ship they do reach the inside of the great barrier and find a planet where they do meet a god-like alien this one is so bad it is hard to figure out where to begin at the core is a good idea that is never really developed the plot goes nowhere instead of where no man has gone before it is almost like the writers had no idea how to end this fiasco the action scenes don't have the suspense of wrath of kahn the philosophy is boring and the humor is stale now i will focus most of my anger on william shatner when he takes the director's chair the ego gets bigger most of the focus is on him spock and mccoy but does not give the others enough to do moreover whereas shatner is usually guilty of over-acting in previous movies and television spots he is just plain bad in this one now kirk is reckless a practical jokers and silly one of the worst scenes involves the three leaders singing the song ""row row row your boat"" in a round by a campfire in any case this is the worst of the star trek franchise i should have given it three out of ten instead of five","['star', 'trek', 'motion', 'picture', 'boring', 'star', 'trek', 'final', 'frontier', 'plain', 'bad', 'terrible', 'sequel', 'crew', 'shore', 'leave', 'distress', 'signal', 'federation', 'ambassadors', 'representing', 'earth', 'romulus', 'kronos', 'klingon', 'home', 'world', 'kidnapped', 'renegade', 'vulcan', 'bent', 'quest', 'attain', 'starship', 'venture', 'great', 'barrier', 'hopes', 'find', 'god', 'mysticism', 'bad', 'writing', 'persuades', 'senior', 'officers', 'enterprise', 'betray', 'kirk', 'hold', 'ship', 'reach', 'inside', 'great', 'barrier', 'find', 'planet', 'meet', 'god', 'like', 'alien', 'bad', 'hard', 'figure', 'begin', 'core', 'good', 'idea', 'developed', 'plot', 'goes', 'instead', 'man', 'gone', 'like', 'writers', 'idea', 'end', 'fiasco', 'action', 'scenes', 'suspense', 'wrath', 'kahn', 'philosophy', 'boring', 'humor', 'stale', 'focus', 'anger', 'william', 'shatner', 'takes', 'director', 'chair', 'ego', 'gets', 'bigger', 'focus', 'spock', 'mccoy', 'shatner', 'usually', 'guilty', 'acting', 'previous', 'movies', 'television', 'spots', 'plain', 'bad', 'kirk', 'reckless', 'practical', 'jokers', 'silly', 'worst', 'scenes', 'involves', 'leaders', 'singing', 'song', 'row', 'row', 'row', 'boat', 'round', 'campfire', 'case', 'worst', 'star', 'trek', 'franchise', 'given', 'instead']","['star', 'trek', 'motion', 'picture', 'boring', 'star', 'trek', 'final', 'frontier', 'plain', 'bad', 'terrible', 'sequel', 'crew', 'shore', 'leave', 'distress', 'signal', 'federation', 'ambassador', 'represent', 'earth', 'romulus', 'krono', 'klingon', 'home', 'world', 'kidnap', 'renegade', 'vulcan', 'bent', 'quest', 'attain', 'starship', 'venture', 'great', 'barrier', 'hope', 'find', 'god', 'mysticism', 'bad', 'writing', 'persuade', 'senior', 'officer', 'enterprise', 'betray', 'kirk', 'hold', 'ship', 'reach', 'inside', 'great', 'barrier', 'find', 'planet', 'meet', 'god', 'like', 'alien', 'bad', 'hard', 'figure', 'begin', 'core', 'good', 'idea', 'develop', 'plot', 'go', 'instead', 'man', 'go', 'like', 'writer', 'idea', 'end', 'fiasco', 'action', 'scene', 'suspense', 'wrath', 'kahn', 'philosophy', 'boring', 'humor', 'stale', 'focus', 'anger', 'william', 'shatner', 'take', 'director', 'chair', 'ego', 'get', 'big', 'focus', 'spock', 'mccoy', 'shatner', 'usually', 'guilty', 'act', 'previous', 'movie', 'television', 'spot', 'plain', 'bad', 'kirk', 'reckless', 'practical', 'joker', 'silly', 'bad', 'scene', 'involve', 'leader', 'singe', 'song', 'row', 'row', 'row', 'boat', 'round', 'campfire', 'case', 'bad', 'star', 'trek', 'franchise', 'give', 'instead']"
"Despite later claims, this early-talkie melodrama has very little in common with ""Citizen Kane"": It's a biopic of a ruthless but human fictional plutocrat, told in flashback but hopping around time. The scriptwriter, Preston Sturges, shows none of his later gift for sparkling dialog, and none of the myriad cinematic innovations of ""Kane"" are evident. Still, it's very watchable, with a young Spencer Tracy (his old-man makeup makes him look just like, well, an old Spencer Tracy) showing depth and authority, and Colleen Moore -- a little past her prime, and not physically well matched -- playing a multifaceted woman-behind-the-man.

"This is the best version (so far) that you will see and the most true to the Bronte work. Dalton is a little tough to imagine as Rochester who Jane Eyre declared ""not handsome"". But his acting overcomes this and Zelah Clark, pretty as she is, is also a complete and believable Jane Eyre. This production is a lengthy watch but well worth it. Nearly direct quotes from the book are in the script and if you want the very first true 'romance' in literature, this is the way to see it. I own every copy of this movie and have read and re-read the original. The filming may seem a little dated now but there will never be another like this.","this is the best version (so far) that you will see and the most true to the bronte work dalton is a little tough to imagine as rochester who jane eyre declared ""not handsome"" but his acting overcomes this and zelah clark pretty as she is is also a complete and believable jane eyre this production is a lengthy watch but well worth it nearly direct quotes from the book are in the script and if you want the very first true 'romance' in literature this is the way to see it i own every copy of this movie and have read and re-read the original the filming may seem a little dated now but there will never be another like this","['best', 'version', 'far', 'true', 'bronte', 'work', 'dalton', 'little', 'tough', 'imagine', 'rochester', 'jane', 'eyre', 'declared', 'handsome', 'acting', 'overcomes', 'zelah', 'clark', 'pretty', 'complete', 'believable', 'jane', 'eyre', 'production', 'lengthy', 'watch', 'worth', 'nearly', 'direct', 'quotes', 'book', 'script', 'want', 'true', 'romance', 'literature', 'way', 'copy', 'movie', 'read', 'read', 'original', 'filming', 'little', 'dated', 'like']","['good', 'version', 'far', 'true', 'bronte', 'work', 'dalton', 'little', 'tough', 'imagine', 'rochester', 'jane', 'eyre', 'declare', 'handsome', 'acting', 'overcome', 'zelah', 'clark', 'pretty', 'complete', 'believable', 'jane', 'eyre', 'production', 'lengthy', 'watch', 'worth', 'nearly', 'direct', 'quote', 'book', 'script', 'want', 'true', 'romance', 'literature', 'way', 'copy', 'movie', 'read', 'read', 'original', 'filming', 'little', 'date', 'like']"

"I liked Boyle's performance, but that's about the only positive thing I can say. Everything was overdone to the point of absurdity. Most of the actors spoke like you would expect your 9-year-old nephew to speak if he were pretending to be a jaded, stone-hearted cop, or an ultra-evil villain. The raspy voice-overs seemed amateurish to me. I could go buy a cheap synthesizer and crank out better opening music. And what's with the whole 1984ish police torture stuff? It was totally superfluous and had nothing to do with the actual events of the story. Cox added a lot of things, in fact, that he apparently thought would be really cool, but had nothing to do with the story. That's a big disappointment because one of the things that makes Borges' stories so good is his minimalism -- they are tightly bound, with no superfluous details. This movie is just the opposite. I stopped watching after the scene where Lonnrot is questioning the guy from the Yidische Zaitung, or thereabouts. I wasted $4 renting this, but at least I can get some satisfaction from writing this review and hopefully saving others from making the same mistake.",i liked boyle's performance but that's about the only positive thing i can say everything was overdone to the point of absurdity most of the actors spoke like you would expect your 9-year-old nephew to speak if he were pretending to be a jaded stone-hearted cop or an ultra-evil villain the raspy voice-overs seemed amateurish to me i could go buy a cheap synthesizer and crank out better opening music and what's with the whole 1984ish police torture stuff it was totally superfluous and had nothing to do with the actual events of the story cox added a lot of things in fact that he apparently thought would be really cool but had nothing to do with the story that's a big disappointment because one of the things that makes borges' stories so good is his minimalism -- they are tightly bound with no superfluous details this movie is just the opposite i stopped watching after the scene where lonnrot is questioning the guy from the yidische zaitung or thereabouts i wasted $4 renting this but at least i can get some satisfaction from writing this review and hopefully saving others from making the same mistake,"['liked', 'boyle', 'performance', 'positive', 'thing', 'overdone', 'point', 'absurdity', 'actors', 'spoke', 'like', 'expect', 'year', 'old', 'nephew', 'speak', 'pretending', 'jaded', 'stone', 'hearted', 'cop', 'ultra', 'evil', 'villain', 'raspy', 'voice', 'overs', 'amateurish', 'buy', 'cheap', 'synthesizer', 'crank', 'better', 'opening', 'music', 'police', 'torture', 'stuff', 'totally', 'superfluous', 'actual', 'events', 'story', 'cox', 'added', 'lot', 'things', 'fact', 'apparently', 'thought', 'cool', 'story', 'big', 'disappointment', 'things', 'makes', 'borges', 'stories', 'good', 'minimalism', 'tightly', 'bound', 'superfluous', 'details', 'movie', 'opposite', 'stopped', 'watching', 'scene', 'lonnrot', 'questioning', 'guy', 'yidische', 'zaitung', 'thereabouts', 'wasted', 'renting', 'satisfaction', 'writing', 'review', 'hopefully', 'saving', 'making', 'mistake']","['like', 'boyle', 'performance', 'positive', 'thing', 'overdone', 'point', 'absurdity', 'actor', 'speak', 'like', 'expect', 'year', 'old', 'nephew', 'speak', 'pretend', 'jade', 'stone', 'hearted', 'cop', 'ultra', 'evil', 'villain', 'raspy', 'voice', 'over', 'amateurish', 'buy', 'cheap', 'synthesizer', 'crank', 'well', 'opening', 'music', 'police', 'torture', 'stuff', 'totally', 'superfluous', 'actual', 'event', 'story', 'cox', 'add', 'lot', 'thing', 'fact', 'apparently', 'think', 'cool', 'story', 'big', 'disappointment', 'thing', 'make', 'borge', 'story', 'good', 'minimalism', 'tightly', 'bind', 'superfluous', 'detail', 'movie', 'opposite', 'stop', 'watch', 'scene', 'lonnrot', 'question', 'guy', 'yidische', 'zaitung', 'thereabout', 'waste', 'rent', 'satisfaction', 'write', 'review', 'hopefully', 'save', 'make', 'mistake']"

"The Assignment is an outstanding thriller with several plot twists driven by character, rather than star turns, the need to stage special effects, obligatory romance, and endless car chases. However, there is a car chase in here, and a dandy it is. Aidan Quinn is wonderful as both the terrorist and the naval officer ""recruited"" to eliminate him. It is rare that a second or third tier actor, such as Quinn, is given an important starring role like this that carries a film. Usually, such a role is given to an A-list actor with box office draw, which is probably why I never heard of this film before I saw it. Donald Sutherland is great as the morally ambiguous, somewhat creepy at times, agent that recruits Quinn. Ben Kingsley is fine also as the Israeli agent. The plot is very complex and there are multiple story lines, which converge in gradual fashion toward the end, and not all at once as we're used to seeing. The paranoia and claustrophobia of these type of thrillers is captured and portrayed with both moral ambiguity and frightening intensity. The locations are convincing and effective. The soundtrack is nothing special, but rarely do we get all of the above mentioned qualities these days, without dumb and/or meaningless plot developments; unconvincing star turns; loud, annoying, music video type soundtracks; a villain that hams it up; and repeatedly a cast, costumes, and plot that cater mostly to an audience under 25. This is an outstanding thriller, which most assuredly did not get its just due upon its release. ***1/2 of 4 stars.","the assignment is an outstanding thriller with several plot twists driven by character rather than star turns the need to stage special effects obligatory romance and endless car chases however there is a car chase in here and a dandy it is aidan quinn is wonderful as both the terrorist and the naval officer ""recruited"" to eliminate him it is rare that a second or third tier actor such as quinn is given an important starring role like this that carries a film usually such a role is given to an a-list actor with box office draw which is probably why i never heard of this film before i saw it donald sutherland is great as the morally ambiguous somewhat creepy at times agent that recruits quinn ben kingsley is fine also as the israeli agent the plot is very complex and there are multiple story lines which converge in gradual fashion toward the end and not all at once as we're used to seeing the paranoia and claustrophobia of these type of thrillers is captured and portrayed with both moral ambiguity and frightening intensity the locations are convincing and effective the soundtrack is nothing special but rarely do we get all of the above mentioned qualities these days without dumb and/or meaningless plot developments; unconvincing star turns; loud annoying music video type soundtracks; a villain that hams it up; and repeatedly a cast costumes and plot that cater mostly to an audience under 25 this is an outstanding thriller which most assuredly did not get its just due upon its release ***1/2 of 4 stars","['assignment', 'outstanding', 'thriller', 'plot', 'twists', 'driven', 'character', 'star', 'turns', 'need', 'stage', 'special', 'effects', 'obligatory', 'romance', 'endless', 'car', 'chases', 'car', 'chase', 'dandy', 'aidan', 'quinn', 'wonderful', 'terrorist', 'naval', 'officer', 'recruited', 'eliminate', 'rare', 'second', 'tier', 'actor', 'quinn', 'given', 'important', 'starring', 'role', 'like', 'carries', 'film', 'usually', 'role', 'given', 'list', 'actor', 'box', 'office', 'draw', 'probably', 'heard', 'film', 'saw', 'donald', 'sutherland', 'great', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'somewhat', 'creepy', 'times', 'agent', 'recruits', 'quinn', 'ben', 'kingsley', 'fine', 'israeli', 'agent', 'plot', 'complex', 'multiple', 'story', 'lines', 'converge', 'gradual', 'fashion', 'end', 'seeing', 'paranoia', 'claustrophobia', 'type', 'thrillers', 'captured', 'portrayed', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'frightening', 'intensity', 'locations', 'convincing', 'effective', 'soundtrack', 'special', 'rarely', 'mentioned', 'qualities', 'days', 'dumb', 'meaningless', 'plot', 'developments', 'unconvincing', 'star', 'turns', 'loud', 'annoying', 'music', 'video', 'type', 'soundtracks', 'villain', 'hams', 'repeatedly', 'cast', 'costumes', 'plot', 'cater', 'audience', 'outstanding', 'thriller', 'assuredly', 'release', 'stars']","['assignment', 'outstanding', 'thriller', 'plot', 'twist', 'drive', 'character', 'star', 'turn', 'need', 'stage', 'special', 'effect', 'obligatory', 'romance', 'endless', 'car', 'chase', 'car', 'chase', 'dandy', 'aidan', 'quinn', 'wonderful', 'terrorist', 'naval', 'officer', 'recruit', 'eliminate', 'rare', 'second', 'tier', 'actor', 'quinn', 'give', 'important', 'star', 'role', 'like', 'carry', 'film', 'usually', 'role', 'give', 'list', 'actor', 'box', 'office', 'draw', 'probably', 'hear', 'film', 'see', 'donald', 'sutherland', 'great', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'somewhat', 'creepy', 'times', 'agent', 'recruit', 'quinn', 'ben', 'kingsley', 'fine', 'israeli', 'agent', 'plot', 'complex', 'multiple', 'story', 'line', 'converge', 'gradual', 'fashion', 'end', 'see', 'paranoia', 'claustrophobia', 'type', 'thriller', 'capture', 'portray', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'frightening', 'intensity', 'location', 'convincing', 'effective', 'soundtrack', 'special', 'rarely', 'mention', 'quality', 'day', 'dumb', 'meaningless', 'plot', 'development', 'unconvincing', 'star', 'turn', 'loud', 'annoying', 'music', 'video', 'type', 'soundtrack', 'villain', 'ham', 'repeatedly', 'cast', 'costume', 'plot', 'cater', 'audience', 'outstanding', 'thriller', 'assuredly', 'release', 'star']"

"Set in the 1794, the second year of the French republic formed after the execution of Louis XVI, this film portrays the power struggle between the revolutionary leaders Danton (Gerard Depardieu, at his finest) and Robespierre (a commanding performance by the Polish actor Wojciech Pszoniak). The moderate revolutionary Danton has returned to Paris from his country seat where he has been since being deposed as leader of the Committee of Public Safety in the previous year by Robespierre. He is opposed to ""The Reign Of Terror"" which has resulted in the executions of thousands of citizens, mainly by guillotine, who are thought to be opposed to the Revolution. Danton is confident of the support of the ordinary people and tries to persuade Robespierre to curb the bloodletting. But Robespierre and the Committee are afraid that the popularity of Danton will lead to them being overthrown, and put Danton and his supporters on trial for being traitors. This was the first French language film made by Andrzej Wajda after he had arrived in France from Poland. His Polish film company was closed down by the government due to his support for the Solidarity trade union, which had opposed the Polish government in the late seventies and early eighties. His previous film ""Man Of Iron"" (1981) had dealt with the Solidarity union and its leader Lech Walesa, and it is easy to draw comparisons between the relationship of Walesa and the Polish leader General Jaruselski, and that between Danton and Robespierre. Danton/Walesa are the voice of reason opposed to Robespierre/Jaruselski who continue dictatorial rule despite having lost the support of the people they claim to represent. The film is based on the Polish play ""The Danton Affair"" written by Stanislawa Przybyszewska in the 1930s, and on its release the film was criticised by some for being static and theatrical. But what the film does is to concentrate on the behind-the-scenes meetings of the Committees and the scenes in the National Assembly and the courtroom rather than the activities on the streets of Paris.","set in the 1794 the second year of the french republic formed after the execution of louis xvi this film portrays the power struggle between the revolutionary leaders danton (gerard depardieu

"I have now seen quite a few films by Pedro Almodóvar, but this would have to be the most disappointing so far. This film seemed to lack the zaniness that is usually everywhere in his films, and the story just never got me interested. Many Almodóvar regulars appear in this film, so it's not like there was a lack of on-screen talent, but this film just seemed more serious than his other films.

"I greatly enjoyed Margaret Atwood's novel 'The Robber Bride', and I was thrilled to see there was a movie version. A woman frames a cop boyfriend for her own murder, and his buddy, an ex-cop journalist, tries to clear his name by checking up on the dead woman's crazy female friends. It's fortunate that the movie script fixes Ms. Atwood's clumsy plotting by focusing on the story of these two men, victims of scheming women...<br /><br />Heh. Okay, you got me. If these guys are mentioned in the book, and I'm pretty sure they're entirely made up for the movie, I'll eat the dust cover of my hardback copy. Apparently, the three main female characters of the novel aren't enough to carry the movie. Zenia's manipulations aren't interesting unless we see them happen to a man, and a man's life is screwed up. Roz, Charis, and Toni tell their stories -- to a man. Because it's not important if a man doesn't hear them.<br /><br />I liked the characters in the book. It hurts to see them pushed off to the side for a man's story. I normally do not look for feminist angles on media, and I tried to enjoy the movie as is. If I hadn't read the book, I might have enjoyed the movie a lot more. So if you like the cop and the ex-cop, and you want to read more about them, you're out of luck. Read the novel, if you want to enjoy luscious prose and characterization subtly layered through a plot. It's the same plot: the movie excavated it, ironed it, and sprinkled it with male angst.

"Ingrid Bergman, playing dentist Walter Matthau's faithful receptionist who harbors a little crush on her boss, is absolutely wonderful in this film. She handles the witty repartee in the script with aplomb and steals a terrific scene where she and Goldie Hawn talk in a record booth (Ingrid's monologue is a front, but her face tells you she believes in it with all her heart). Matthau is an odd choice for the leading man (he's too old for Goldie Hawn and too unrefined for Bergman, not to mention too unfocused to be a dentist), but I liked the way he tries hard to please Goldie and stumbles around trying to free himself from a lie. Hawn (who won a Supporting Oscar) is just as fresh and bubbly as she is today.

That word was the only thing that could help this film, because, as everyone knows, bad films can make much more money simply by having the word 'Zombie' appear in the title. Knowing what Victor Halperin was capable of a few years before only makes this uninteresting film more insulting. It seems he never directed another horror film after this debacle. The zombies here seem not to be true walking dead, but simply hypnotism victims.<br /><br />Wanna create a mind-controlled army of zombies? Be ready to crack a few eggs, including your own.<br /><br />THE LAME PLOT: Man falls in love with scheming woman who plays with his heart and becomes engaged to him only to make his friend, whom she loves, jealous. This sends man into a spiral of madness in which he tries using zombie mind-control techniques to change things to his advantage in an attempt to win over a woman who isn't worth spit.<br /><br />This includes one of the most blatantly obvious plot developments I've ever seen. You'd have to be blind or stupid not to see the ending coming. The acting isn't even good. This movie makes the racially insensitive ""King of the Zombies"" (which appeared on the same double bill DVD I bought) seems like an atmospheric horror masterpiece by comparison and reminds us that not every black and white film is a classic. It makes the atomic age sci-fi alien zombie cheese fest ""Invisible Invaders"" seem like a serious drama. This is one big ball of cheese so ridiculously melodramatic it could probably make many a Korean film fan twitch (South Korean films are often known for their use of melodrama). The credits list the ironically named company Favorite Films. I'm not sure whose favorite film this would be, but they're obviously an idiot.<br /><br />Not recommended for fans of: zombies, romance, or classic films.","""revolt of the zombies"" proves that

"The complaints are valid, to me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too aimed for women. I am okay with these night time soaps, like Grey's Anatomy, or Ugly Betty, or West Wing, because there are stories that are interesting even with the given that they will never end. However, when the idea parallels the daytime soaps aimed at just putting hunky men (Taye Diggs, Tim Daly, and Chris Lowell) into sexual tension and romps, and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in a so-called little hospital, it seems like General Hospital...or a female counterpart to Baywatch. That was what men wanted and they had it, so if this is what women want so be it, but the idea that this is a high brow show (or something men will watch) is unrealistic.",the complaints are valid to me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too aimed for women i am okay with these night time soaps like grey's anatomy or ugly betty or west wing because there are stories that are interesting even with the given that they will never end however when the idea parallels the daytime soaps aimed at just putting hunky men (taye diggs tim daly and chris lowell) into sexual tension and romps and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in a so-called little hospital it seems like general hospitalor a female counterpart to baywatch that was what men wanted and they had it so if this is what women want so be it but the idea that this is a high brow show (or something men will watch) is unrealistic,"['complaints', 'valid', 'biggest', 'problem', 'soap', 'opera', 'aimed', 'women', 'okay', 'night', 'time', 'soaps', 'like', 'grey', 'anatomy', 'ugly', 'betty', 'west', 'wing', 'stories', 'interesting', 'given', 'end', 'idea', 'parallels', 'daytime', 'soaps', 'aimed', 'putting', 'hunky', 'men', 'taye', 'diggs', 'tim', 'daly', 'chris', 'lowell', 'sexual', 'tension', 'romps', 'numerous', 'ridiculous', 'difficult', 'situations', 'called', 'little', 'hospital', 'like', 'general', 'hospitalor', 'female', 'counterpart', 'baywatch', 'men', 'wanted', 'women', 'want', 'idea', 'high', 'brow', 'men', 'watch', 'unrealistic']","['complaint', 'valid', 'big', 'problem', 'soap', 'opera', 'aim', 'woman', 'okay', 'night', 'time', 'soap', 'like', 'grey', 'anatomy', 'ugly', 'betty', 'west', 'wing', 'story', 'interesting', 'give', 'end', 'idea', 'parallel', 'daytime', 'soap', 'aim', 'put', 'hunky', 'man', 'taye', 'diggs', 'tim', 'daly', 'chris', 'lowell', 'sexual', 'tension', 'romp', 'numerous', 'ridiculous', 'difficult', 'situation', 'call', 'little', 'hospital', 'like', 'general', 'hospitalor', 'female', 'counterpart', 'baywatch', 'man', 'want', 'woman', 'want', 'idea', 'high', 'brow', 'man', 'watch', 'unrealistic']"
"This movie was one of the best movies that I have seen this year. I didn't see any cameos in the movie, but it is still pretty good. It is similar to Anchorman in the humor department, but I think this is a better put together movie. It actually has a point. If you are going to see a whole bunch of T&A you will be disappointed. Just a well put together movie!!!! If you have nothing to do for the day or you need a lot of humor, you will find this to be a really good movie. I definitely think that Ebert and Roeper's review of this movie is right on. I mean, I don't really like Ebert on most movies, but this is the movie that I will agree about. The movie contains a good enough story that it is actually believable that these type of people are out there. There is definitely something to be said about how they treat virginity in this movie. Yea, sure, you get laughed at when it is found out about, but it still suggests that you wait. Steve did a wonderful job of portraying the person that he did in this movie and yet, it is still funny.",this movie was one of the best movies that i have seen this year i didn't see any cameos in the movie but it is still pretty good it is similar to anchorman in the humor department but i think this is a better put together movie it actually has a point if you are going to see a whole bunch of t&a you will be disappointed just a well put together movie if you have nothing to do for the day or you need a lot of humor you will find this to be a really good movie i definitely think that ebert and roeper's review of this movie is right on i mean i don't really like ebert on most movies but this is the movie that i will agree about the movie contains a good enough story that it is actually believable that these type of people are out there there is definitely something to be said about how they treat virginity in this movie yea sure you get laughed at when it is found out about but it still suggests that you wait steve did a wonderful job of portraying the person that he did in this movie and yet it is still funny,"['movie', 'best', 'movies', 'seen', 'year', 'cameos', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'similar', 'anchorman', 'humor', 'department', 'think', 'better', 'movie', 'actually', 'point', 'going', 'bunch', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'day', 'need', 'lot', 'humor', 'find', 'good', 'movie', 'definitely', 'think', 'ebert', 'roeper', 'review', 'movie', 'right', 'mean', 'like', 'ebert', 'movies', 'movie', 'agree', 'movie', 'contains', 'good', 'story', 'actually', 'believable', 'type', 'people', 'definitely', 'said', 'treat', 'virginity', 'movie', 'yea', 'sure', 'laughed', 'found', 'suggests', 'wait', 'steve', 'wonderful', 'job', 'portraying', 'person', 'movie', 'funny']","['movie', 'good', 'movie', 'see', 'year', 'cameo', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'similar', 'anchorman', 'humor', 'department', 'think', 'well', 'movie', 'actually', 'point', 'go', 'bunch', 'disappoint', 'movie', 'day', 'need', 'lot', 'humor', 'find', 'good', 'movie', 'definitely', 'think', 'ebert', 'roeper', 'review', 'movie', 'right', 'mean', 'like', 'ebert', 'movie', 'movie', 'agree', 'movie', 'contain', 'good', 'story', 'actually', 'believable', 'type', 'people', 'definitely', 'say', 'treat', 'virginity', 'movie', 'yea', 'sure', 'laugh', 'find', 'suggest', 'wait', 'steve', 'wonderful', 'job', 'portray', 'person', 'movie', 'funny']"

"Two hours ago I was watching this brilliant movie which overwhelmed me with its imprisoning photography. It is quite understandable how it won the prize of Best Camera in Cannes 2000. Close ups predominated it. Close ups of walls, humans and of many other things. The warm colored lighting (which is also usually by the director) gave the movie a warm atmosphere. Only two persons are principally to be seen in most of it. An interesting music and especially three songs or themes accompanied the movie nearly all the time. Each one of these themes represented a certain atmosphere during the whole movie. Silence and slow movements characterize the movie. Some scenes were extended moments or a serious of close-ups. Not only Tony Leung deserves a prize for his superb acting since Maggie Cheung was also so brilliant. I wonder how many dresses she was wearing in the different scenes. The story was also connected somehow with the history of Hong Kong and the region the 1960s. This prevented me from understanding some details of the it especially at the end. In short I would recommend the fans of artistic movies to watch it in the cinema.",two hours ago i was watching this brilliant movie which overwhelmed me with its imprisoning photography it is quite understandable how it won the prize of best camera in cannes 2000 close ups predominated it close ups of walls humans and of many other things the warm colored lighting (which is also usually by the director) gave the movie a warm atmosphere only two persons are principally to be seen in most of it an interesting music and especially three songs or themes accompanied the movie nearly all the time each one of these themes represented a certain atmosphere during the whole movie silence and slow movements characterize the movie some scenes were extended moments or a serious of close-ups not only tony leung deserves a prize for his superb acting since maggie cheung was also so brilliant i wonder how many dresses she was wearing in the different scenes the story was also connected somehow with the history of hong kong and the region the 1960s this prevented me from understanding some details of the it especially at the end in short i would recommend the fans of artistic movies to watch it in the cinema,"['hours', 'ago', 'watching', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'overwhelmed', 'imprisoning', 'photography', 'understandable', 'won', 'prize', 'best', 'camera', 'cannes', 'close', 'ups', 'predominated', 'close', 'ups', 'walls', 'humans', 'things', 'warm', 'colored', 'lighting', 'usually', 'director', 'gave', 'movie', 'warm', 'atmosphere', 'persons', 'principally', 'seen', 'interesting', 'music', 'especially', 'songs', 'themes', 'accompanied', 'movie', 'nearly', 'time', 'themes', 'represented', 'certain', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'silence', 'slow', 'movements', 'characterize', 'movie', 'scenes', 'extended', 'moments', 'close', 'ups', 'tony', 'leung', 'deserves', 'prize', 'superb', 'acting', 'maggie', 'cheung', 'brilliant', 'wonder', 'dresses', 'wearing', 'different', 'scenes', 'story', 'connected', 'history', 'hong', 'kong', 'region', 'prevented', 'understanding', 'details', 'especially', 'end', 'short', 'recommend', 'fans', 'artistic', 'movies', 'watch', 'cinema']","['hour', 'ago', 'watch', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'overwhelm', 'imprison', 'photography', 'understandable', 'win', 'prize', 'good', 'camera', 'canne', 'close', 'up', 'predominate', 'close', 'up', 'wall', 'human', 'thing', 'warm', 'colored', 'lighting', 'usually', 'director', 'give', 'movie', 'warm', 'atmosphere', 'person', 'principally', 'see', 'interesting', 'music', 'especially', 'song', 'theme', 'accompany', 'movie', 'nearly', 'time', 'theme', 'represent', 'certain', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'silence', 'slow', 'movement', 'characterize', 'movie', 'scene', 'extend', 'moment', 'close', 'up', 'tony', 'leung', 'deserve', 'prize', 'superb', 'act', 'maggie', 'cheung', 'brilliant', 'wonder', 'dress', 'wear', 'different', 'scene', 'story', 'connect', 'history', 'hong', 'kong', 'region', 'prevent', 'understand', 'detail', 'especially', 'end', 'short', 'recommend', 'fan', 'artistic', 'movie', 'watch', 'cinema']"
"Luckily for Bill Murray this is such a light-weight project since he pretty much has to carry it. Meatballs is the story of low-rent Camp Northstar and how its counselors deal with the campers as well as one another. Then there is much made of their wealthy rivals from across the lake named Camp Mohawk which culminates in a two-day Olympiad competition. Above it all is Bill Murray clowning around and making a pretty memorable film debut.<br /><br />The film is sprinkled with medium-sized laughs, chuckles, and more than a few guffaws along the way. The biggest laughs come from the pranks played on the nerdy camp director. Three of them involve the counselors moving his bed outside in various locations while he's sleeping. Morty, or ""Micky"" as everyone calls him, wakes up along the side of a road, strung up in some trees several feet above the ground, and finally floating on a raft in the middle of the lake! There are also some funny moments involving the counselors hitting on one another, but this is a PG rated film with little in the way of raunchiness.<br /><br />The film takes a serious note involving a shy camper named Rudy who is played by Chris Makepeace. Of course it's up to Murray to teach the kid how to open up, and give him the confidence he needs to run a marathon during the Olympiad. The sentimentality of Rudy's situation seems tacked on to a great degree. Notice how when Murray first sees the kid sitting alone in the grass after getting off the bus he tells him, ""you must be the short depressed kid we ordered."" Makes you wonder if that line was really in the script or Murray was just ad-libbing while the cameras were rolling. In other words, Murray might as well have said to Makepeace, ""you must be that actor we hired to play the stereotypical lonely kid you see in most summer camp films who doesn't fit in."" But before it's all over, Murray's performance makes this plot device more than bearable. He really seems to have some good chemistry with Makepeace.<br /><br />The film culminates with the games between the two rival camps. Very little of the events we are shown are even slightly believable, but ""it just doesn't matter"". This is a pretty good film on many levels. Don't let the absurd 5.6 rating this film is currently getting scare you off. Murray will keep you laughing throughout. Just be warned..... avoid the sequels!!!! Especially the one with Corey Feldman!! 8 of 10 stars.<br /><br />The Hound.","luckily for bill murray this is such a light-weight project since he pretty much has to carry it meatballs is the story

"""The Danish Bladerunner"" is boldly stated on the box. Are you kidding me?! This film is a complete drag. When I'm thirsty and go for a soda in the kitchen, I usually pause the vcr, so I won't miss anything. Not this time.

Why the hell is there not ONE sciencefiction-scriptwriter out there who has the vaguest clue about how computers work? It's mindboggling.

"This film could have been a decent re-make, and gosh knows it tried (or Ms. English tried). Assembling talented actors together with a successful & experienced writer/director should be a formula for a decent film. But Ms. English's experience - according to her IMDb bio - is exclusively limited to television work, and it is glaringly obvious throughout this film.<br /><br />I am surprised that none of the reviews I have read mention what I found most unlikeable about this film, and what kept it from reaching even a portion of its potential: it looked and felt like it was made for television. To give some credit to Ms. English, many of the jokes that simply did NOT work on a movie screen would have been terrific on TV (and maybe a laugh track would have helped). So much of the camera usage and the lighting would have played out fine on TV but looked awkward or odd on a big screen. If the whole film had been chopped up into a mini-series or a sit-com, I think it could have worked. But this is cinema and sadly Ms. English's talents didn't translate. I cringed at so many different points in my embarrassment for the actors & the writers that I felt like I came out of the theater half shriveled! Meg Ryan is her usual perky, cute self (except for the awful plastic surgery she has had on her face), but where did she have a chance to use her talent?! She has made films where she doesn't recreate her stereo-typed role and done them well... but not here. Annette Bening seemed to simply go through the motions - such a great talent and yet such a poor performance! I enjoyed the other women characters but they were more caricature than substance, and it was sad to see. What worked in this film in the 1930s doesn't translate to the 2000s, and no one helped Ms. English get the changes & updates or subtleties right. If only she (as writer, director AND producer) had reached out for some assistance, I think it could have been good. But it was not.<br /><br />It's so frustrating to go to a movie that has good stars and a good writer or director and come away feeling it was a waste of everyone's time & money! This New Yorker cartoon I saw yesterday is appropriate: A few movie execs are having a meeting & the caption reads: ""Let's remake a classic with worse everything!""","this film could have been a decent re-make and gosh knows it tried (or ms english tried) assembling talented actors together with a successful & experienced writer/director should be a formula for a decent film but ms english's experience -

"C'mon guys some previous reviewers have nearly written a novel commenting on this episode. It's just an old 60's TV show ! This episode of Star Trek is notable because of the most serious babe (Yeoman Barrow's) ever used on Star Trek and the fact that it was filmed in a real outdoor location.

"I just watched this movie on it's premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia. I liked (not loved) ""Mork & Mindy"" as a kid, mostly for Robin William's zany energetic performance. This movie made me remember why. Was the original show great? Not really, but Robin certainly was. Which brings me to this movie.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised, expecting nothing more than a paint by numbers chronological retelling of the show (which in a way it was). But, of course, the real focus was on Robin. It was interesting to see Robin's journey from struggling street jester to national t.v star, and how such a drastic difference affected him and his long suffering wife. And my hat is off to star Chris Diamantopoulos as he portrayed Mr. Williams with integrity, sensitivity, and heart; not just a cute impression, although it was even dead-on. (On an unrelated note, I noticed that Robin's struggles were in some ways similar to Andy Kaufman, who was under-appreciated by network t.v. and held back creatively, but that's the ""Taxi"" behind the scenes biopic.)<br /><br />All in all, this was a very enjoyable flick, in which I felt I got to know a little more of the man behind the Orkan. The acting was solid by all- never melodramatic like I suspected- and the story moved along well. Performances that were particularly good were by those who played Garry Marshall and John Belushi (the scene in which Belushi heckles Robin was a hoot!). Not a great masterpiece by any means (I would have liked to have seen a tad more about Pam Dawber), but definitely watchable, especially for those Robin Williams and ""Mork & Mindy"" fans out there. Nanoo, nanoo!","i just watched this movie on it's premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia i liked (not loved) ""mork & mindy"" as a kid mostly for robin william's zany energetic performance this movie made me remember why was the original show great not really but robin certainly was which brings me to this movie<br /><br />i was pleasantly surprised expecting nothing more than a paint by numbers chronological retelling of the show (which in a way it was) but of course the real focus was on robin it was interesting to see robin's journey from struggling street jester to national tv star and how such a drastic difference affected him and his long suffering wife and my hat is off to star chris diamantopoulos as he portrayed mr williams with integrity sensitivity and heart; not just a cute impression although it was even dead-on (on an unrelated note i noticed that robin's struggles were in some ways similar to andy kaufman who was under-appreciated by network tv and held back creatively but that's the ""taxi"" behind the scenes biopic)<br /><br />all in all this was a very enjoyable flick in which i felt i got to know a little more of the man behind the orkan the acting was solid by all- never melodramatic like i suspected- and the story moved along well performances that were particularly good were by those who played garry marshall and john belushi (the scene in which belushi heckles robin was a hoot) not a great masterpiece by any means (i would have liked to have seen a tad more about pam dawber) but definitely watchable especially for those robin williams and ""mork & mindy"" fans out there nanoo nanoo","['watched', 'movie', 'premier', 'night', 'curiosity', 'sheer', 'nostalgia', 'liked', 'loved', 'mork', 'mindy', 'kid', 'robin', 'william', 'zany', 'energetic', 'performance', 'movie', 'remember', 'original', 'great', 'robin', 'certainly', 'brings', 'movie', 'br', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'expecting', 'paint', 'numbers', 'chronological', 'retelling', 'way', 'course', 'real', 'focus', 'robin', 'interesting', 'robin', 'journey', 'struggling', 'street', 'jester', 'national', 'tv', 'star', 'drastic', 'difference', 'affected', 'long', 'suffering', 'wife', 'hat', 'star', 'chris', 'diamantopoulos', 'portrayed', 'mr', 'williams', 'integrity', 'sensitivity', 'heart', 'cute', 'impression', 'dead', 'unrelated', 'note', 'noticed', 'robin', 'struggles', 'ways', 'similar', 'andy', 'kaufman', 'appreciated', 'network', 'tv', 'held', 'creatively', 'taxi', 'scenes', 'enjoyable', 'flick', 'felt', 'got', 'know', 'little', 'man', 'orkan', 'acting', 'solid', 'melodramatic', 'like', 'story', 'moved', 'performances', 'particularly', 'good', 'played', 'garry', 'marshall', 'john', 'belushi', 'scene', 'belushi', 'heckles', 'robin', 'hoot', 'great', 'masterpiece', 'means', 'liked', 'seen', 'tad', 'pam', 'dawber', 'definitely', 'watchable', 'especially', 'robin', 'williams', 'mork', 'mindy', 'fans', 'nanoo', 'nanoo']","['watch', 'movie', 'premier', 'night', 'curiosity', 'sheer', 'nostalgia', 'like', 'love', 'mork', 'mindy', 'kid', 'robin', 'william', 'zany', 'energetic', 'performance', 'movie', 'remember', 'original', 'great', 'robin', 'certainly', 'bring', 'movie', 'br', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'expect', 'paint', 'number', 'chronological', 'retelling', 'way', 'course', 'real', 'focus', 'robin', 'interesting', 'robin', 'journey', 'struggle', 'street', 'jester', 'national', 'tv', 'star', 'drastic', 'difference', 'affect', 'long', 'suffer', 'wife', 'hat', 'star', 'chris', 'diamantopoulos', 'portray', 'mr', 'williams', 'integrity', 'sensitivity', 'heart', 'cute', 'impression', 'dead', 'unrelated', 'note', 'notice', 'robin', 'struggle', 'way', 'similar', 'andy', 'kaufman', 'appreciate', 'network', 'tv', 'hold', 'creatively', 'taxi', 'scene', 'enjoyable', 'flick', 'feel', 'get', 'know', 'little', 'man', 'orkan', 'acting', 'solid', 'melodramatic', 'like', 'story', 'move', 'performance', 'particularly', 'good', 'play', 'garry', 'marshall', 'john', 'belushi', 'scene', 'belushi', 'heckles', 'robin', 'hoot', 'great', 'masterpiece', 'mean', 'like', 'see', 'tad', 'pam', 'dawber', 'definitely', 'watchable', 'especially', 'robin', 'williams', 'mork', 'mindy', 'fan', 'nanoo', 'nanoo']"
"I caught this film on AZN on cable. It sounded like it would be a good film, a Japanese ""Green Card"". I can't say I've ever disliked an Asian film, quite the contrary. Some of the most incredible horror films of all time are Japanese and Korean, and I am a HUGE fan of John Woo's Hong Kong films. I an not adverse to a light hearted films, like Tampopo or Chung King Express (two of my favourites), so I thought I would like this. Well, I would rather slit my wrists and drink my own blood than watch this laborious, badly acted film ever again.<br /><br />I think the director Steven Okazaki must have spiked the water with Quaalude, because no one in this film had a personality. And when any of the characters DID try to act, as opposed to mumbling a line or two, their performance came across as forced and incredibly fake. I honestly did not think that anyone had ever acted before...the ONLY person who sounded genuine was Brenda Aoki.. I find it amazing that this is promoted as a comedy, because I didn't laugh once. Even MORE surprising is that CBS morning news called this ""a refreshing breath of comedy"". It was neither refreshing, nor a breath of comedy. And the ending was very predictable, the previous reviewer must be an idiot to think such things.<br /><br />AVOID this film unless you want to see a boring predictable plot line and wooden acting. I actually think that ""Spike of Bensonhurst"" is a better acted film than this...and I walked out half way through that film!","i caught this film on azn on cable it sounded like it would be a good film a japanese ""green card"" i can't say i've ever disliked an asian film quite the contrary some of the most incredible horror films of all time are japanese and korean and i am a huge fan of john woo's hong kong films i an not adverse to a light hearted films like tampopo or chung king express (two of my favourites) so i thought i would like this well i would rather slit my wrists and drink my own blood than watch this laborious badly acted film ever again<br /><br />i think the director steven okazaki must have spiked the water with quaalude because no one in this film had a personality and when any of the characters did try to act as opposed to mumbling a line or two their performance came across as forced and incredibly fake i honestly did not think that anyone had ever acted beforethe only person who sounded genuine was brenda aoki i find it amazing that this is promoted as a comedy because i didn't laugh once even more surprising is that cbs morning news called this ""a refreshing breath of comedy"" it was neither refreshing nor a breath of comedy and the ending was very predictable the previous reviewer must be an idiot to think such things<br /><br />avoid this film unless you want to see a boring predictable plot line and wooden acting i actually think that ""spike of bensonhurst"" is a better acted film than thisand i walked out half way through that film","['caught', 'film', 'azn', 'cable', 'sounded', 'like', 'good', 'film', 'japanese', 'green', 'card', 'disliked', 'asian', 'film', 'contrary', 'incredible', 'horror', 'films', 'time', 'japanese', 'korean', 'huge', 'fan', 'john', 'woo', 'hong', 'kong', 'films', 'adverse', 'light', 'hearted', 'films', 'like', 'tampopo', 'chung', 'king', 'express', 'favourites', 'thought', 'like', 'slit', 'wrists', 'drink', 'blood', 'watch', 'laborious', 'badly', 'acted', 'film', 'br', 'think', 'director', 'steven', 'okazaki', 'spiked', 'water', 'quaalude', 'film', 'personality', 'characters', 'try', 'act', 'opposed', 'mumbling', 'line', 'performance', 'came', 'forced', 'incredibly', 'fake', 'honestly', 'think', 'acted', 'beforethe', 'person', 'sounded', 'genuine', 'brenda', 'aoki', 'find', 'amazing', 'promoted', 'comedy', 'laugh', 'surprising', 'cbs', 'morning', 'news', 'called', 'refreshing', 'breath', 'comedy', 'refreshing', 'breath', 'comedy', 'ending', 'predictable', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'idiot', 'think', 'things', 'br', 'film', 'want', 'boring', 'predictable', 'plot', 'line', 'wooden', 'acting', 'actually', 'think', 'spike', 'bensonhurst', 'better', 'acted', 'film', 'thisand', 'walked', 'half', 'way', 'film']","['catch', 'film', 'azn', 'cable', 'sound', 'like', 'good', 'film', 'japanese', 'green', 'card', 'dislike', 'asian', 'film', 'contrary', 'incredible', 'horror', 'film', 'time', 'japanese', 'korean', 'huge', 'fan', 'john', 'woo', 'hong', 'kong', 'film', 'adverse', 'light', 'hearted', 'film', 'like', 'tampopo', 'chung', 'king', 'express', 'favourite', 'think', 'like', 'slit', 'wrist', 'drink', 'blood', 'watch', 'laborious', 'badly', 'act', 'film', 'br', 'think', 'director', 'steven', 'okazaki', 'spike', 'water', 'quaalude', 'film', 'personality', 'character', 'try', 'act', 'oppose', 'mumble', 'line', 'performance', 'come', 'force', 'incredibly', 'fake', 'honestly', 'think', 'act', 'beforethe', 'person', 'sound', 'genuine', 'brenda', 'aoki', 'find', 'amazing', 'promote', 'comedy', 'laugh', 'surprising', 'cbs', 'morning', 'news', 'call', 'refresh', 'breath', 'comedy', 'refreshing', 'breath', 'comedy', 'ending', 'predictable', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'idiot', 'think', 'thing', 'br', 'film', 'want', 'boring', 'predictable', 'plot', 'line', 'wooden', 'acting', 'actually', 'think', 'spike', 'bensonhurst', 'well', 'act', 'film', 'thisand', 'walk', 'half', 'way', 'film']"
"Before I begin, let me get something off my chest: I'm a huge fan of John Eyres' first film PROJECT: SHADOWCHASER. The film, a B-grade cross of both THE TERMINATOR & DIE HARD, may not be the work of a cinematic genius, but is a hugely entertaining action film that became a cult hit (& spawned two sequels & a spin off).<br /><br />Judge and Jury begins with Joseph Meeker, a convicted killer who was sent to Death Row following his capture after the so-called ""Bloody Shootout"" (which seems like a poor name for a killing spree  Meeker kills three people while trying to rob a convenience store), being led to the electric chair. There is an amusing scene where Meeker talks to the priest about living for sex but meeting his one true love (who was killed during the shootout), expressing his revenge for the person who killed her  Michael Silvano, a washed-up football star who spends his days watching his son Alex practicing football with his high school team (and ends up harassing his son's coach). But once executed, Meeker returns as a revenant (or as Kelly Perine calls ""a hamburger without the fries""), whose sole aim is to get his revenge, which basically means making Silvano's life a misery.<br /><br />Let me point out the fact that Judge and Jury is not a true horror film. It is a supernatural action film, with Meeker chasing Silvano, using his ability to change form (which amounts to David Keith dressing up as everything from an Elvis impersonator, a French chef (with an accent as bad as his moustache), a drag queen, a clown & a stand-up comedian), a shotgun which fires explosive rounds & an invulnerability to death (although that doesn't stop Martin Kove from shooting Keith with a Desert Eagle), to pay Silvano back for killing Meeker's wife.<br /><br />Director John Eyres does not seem interested in characterisations, instead focusing solely on action scenes, which the film has plenty of. But that is the film's main flaw, since there's nothing to connect the action scenes together. The acting is surprisingly good, with Keith delivering the best performance, supported ably by Kove, as well as Paul Koslo, who plays the washed-up cop quite well. Kelly Perine is annoying as the cabbie who tries to help but makes the situation worse.","before i begin let me get something off my chest: i'm a huge fan of john eyres' first film project:

"Ye Lou's film Purple Butterfly pits a secret organization (Purple Butterfly) against the Japanese forces in war torn Shanghai. Ding Hui (Zhang Ziyi) and her ex-lover Hidehiko Itami (Toru Nakamura) find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict after a chance meeting.<br /><br />I agree with the reviewer from Paris. The film substitutes a convoluted, semi-historical conflict for a plot, without giving the audience a single reason to care about the characters or their causes. The sudden time shifting doesn't help matters as it appears completely unwarranted and pointless. Normally I don't mind dark movies, but the absence of light, the bone-jarringly shaky camera footage, and the generally bad film-making techniques really make this a tough film to watch and stay interested in. I also agree with the viewer from Georgia that this film ""has a chaotic editing style and claustrophobic cinematography"", but I don't think that helps the movie. The backdrop to the film is one of the most potent events of the 20th Century, and I don't believe you can do it any justice by editing it as if it were a Michael Bay film. The overly melodramatic moments don't add to its watchability.<br /><br />The actors are all suitably melancholy. Zhang Ziyi once again shows that she has an exceptionally limited acting range as she spends the entire movie doing what she seems to do best in all her films, brooding and looking generally annoyed. However, at least she adds some variety to this role by chainsmoking and engaging in the worst love-making scene since Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton in The Terminator.<br /><br />All in all, a very disappointing film, especially seeing as how it comes from the director of Suzhou He. 2/10","ye lou's film purple butterfly pits a secret organization (purple butterfly) against the japanese forces in

"After hearing about George Orwell's prophetic masterpiece for all of my life, I'm now 37, but never having read the book, I am totally confused as to what I've just seen.<br /><br />I am very familiar with the concepts covered in the novel, as i'm sure most are, but only through hearsay and quotes. Without this limited knowledge this film would have been a complete mystery, and even with it I'm still no more educated about the story of 1984 than I was before I watched it.<br /><br />On the plus side...<br /><br />The cinematography is amazing, Hurt & Burton deliver fine performances and the overall feel of the movie is wonderfully grim and desolate. The prostitute scene was a fantastically dark piece of film making.<br /><br />Now for the down sides, and there are plenty...<br /><br />There is a war going on, (at least as far as the propaganda is concerned), but why & with who? Nothing is explained. There are a couple of names bandied about (Eurasia etc), but they mean nothing without explanation.<br /><br />Who is Winston? what does he do? where does he come from? where does he work? why is he changing news reports? why isn't he on the front line? Why doesn't he eat the food in the canteen? What is that drink he's drinking through the entire film? Why is he so weak & ill? Why isn't he brainwashed like the rest of them? What's the deal with his mother & sister? What happened to his father? A little back story would have been nice, no scrub that, essential for those like myself that haven't read the book. Without it, this is just a confusing and hard to follow art-house movie that constantly keeps you guessing at what is actually going on.<br /><br />The soundtrack was dis-jointed and badly edited and the constant chatter from the Big Brother screens swamps the dialogue in places making it even harder to work out whats going on. I accept that this may have been an artistic choice but it's very annoying all the same.<br /><br />Also, I know this has been mentioned before, but why all the nudity? It just seemed totally gratuitous and felt like it had been thrown in there to make up for the lack of any plot coverage.<br /><br />I personally can't abide the way Hollywood feels it has to explain story lines word for word these days. We are not all brainwashed simpletons, but this is a few steps too far the other way. I can only imagine that it totally relies on the fact that you've read the book because if this film really is the 'literal translation' that I've seen many people say, I would find it very hard to understand why 1984 is hailed as the classic it is.<br /><br />There's no denying that it was light years ahead of it's time and has pretty much predicted every change in our society to date, (maybe this has been a sort of bible to the powers that be?), but many sci-fi novelists have done the same without leaving gaping holes in the storyline.<br /><br />I guess I have to do what I should have done from the start and buy a copy of the book if i'm to make any sense out of this.<br /><br />All in all, very disappointed in something I've waited for years to watch.",after hearing about george

really is the 'literal translation' that i've seen many people say i would find it very hard to understand why 1984 is hailed as the classic it is<br /><br />there's no denying that it was light years ahead of it's time and has pretty much predicted every change in our society to date (maybe this has been a sort of bible to the powers that be) but many sci-fi novelists have done the same without leaving gaping holes in the storyline<br /><br />i guess i have to do what i should have done from the start and buy a copy of the book if i'm to make any sense out of this<br /><br />all in all very

"I remember seeing this film in the theater in 1984 when I was 6 years-old (you do the math). I absolutely loved it. I was Tarzan for the 2 weeks after seeing it (climbing the furniture, jumping around making monkey sounds). It started a fascination with Tarzan and monkeys, but oddly enough a longer lasting love for Christopher Lambert (keep in mind that I saw Highlander very shortly after this). 1984 was the last time I saw that film, until about a month ago. It happened to be on cable as I was getting ready for bed at 3:30 am and even though it was late and I was tired and I had to be at work at 9:00 am, I stayed up to watch this movie that I loved as a kid. <br /><br />Upon viewing it I realized that it was not that great of a film and even odder then that, that Andie MacDowell's voice was dubbed by someone else. Ian Holme was of course solid as usual, and surprisingly the monkey suits still kind of held up, but what was most surprising was how good Lambert was as Tarzan. He was great! The depth he managed to capture in so few lines, his primal body language and most importantly his ability to bring this character through its extremely large ark, were just amazing.<br /><br />As I stated earlier I am Lambert fan, but I'm used to Highlander, The Hunted and Fortress. In this film he was really quite good and it is a shame that he never got a chance to portray a character with such depth again.<br /><br />So to make a short story way too long, I was a little disappointed that the film was not that good, but I was glad to see that Lambert was good and I do not regret staying up until 6:00am to see it.",i remember seeing this film in the theater in 1984 when i was 6 years-old (you do the math) i absolutely loved it i was tarzan for the 2 weeks after seeing it (climbing the furniture jumping around making monkey sounds) it started a fascination with tarzan and monkeys but oddly enough a longer lasting love for christopher lambert (keep in mind that i saw highlander very shortly after this) 1984 was the last time i saw that film until about a month ago it happened to be on cable as i was getting ready for bed at 3:30 am and even though it was late and i was tired and i had to be at work at 9:00 am i stayed up to watch this movie that i loved as a kid <br /><br />upon viewing it i realized that it was not that great of a film and even odder then that that andie macdowell's voice was dubbed by someone else ian holme was of course solid as usual and surprisingly the monkey suits still kind of held up but what was most surprising was how good lambert was as tarzan he was great the depth he managed to capture in so few lines his primal body language and most importantly his ability to bring this character through its extremely large ark were just amazing<br /><br />as i stated earlier i am lambert fan but i'm used to highlander the hunted and fortress in this film he was really quite good and it is a shame that he never got a chance to portray a character with such depth again<br /><br />so to make a short story way too long i was a little disappointed that the film was not that good but i was glad to see that lambert was good and i do not regret staying up until 6:00am to see it,"['remember', 'seeing', 'film', 'theater', 'years', 'old', 'math', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'tarzan', 'weeks', 'seeing', 'climbing', 'furniture', 'jumping', 'making', 'monkey', 'sounds', 'started', 'fascination', 'tarzan', 'monkeys', 'oddly', 'longer', 'lasting', 'love', 'christopher', 'lambert', 'mind', 'saw', 'highlander', 'shortly', 'time', 'saw', 'film', 'month', 'ago', 'happened', 'cable', 'getting', 'ready', 'bed', 'late', 'tired', 'work', 'stayed', 'watch', 'movie', 'loved', 'kid', 'br', 'viewing', 'realized', 'great', 'film', 'odder', 'andie', 'macdowell', 'voice', 'dubbed', 'ian', 'holme', 'course', 'solid', 'usual', 'surprisingly', 'monkey', 'suits', 'kind', 'held', 'surprising', 'good', 'lambert', 'tarzan', 'great', 'depth', 'managed', 'capture', 'lines', 'primal', 'body', 'language', 'importantly', 'ability', 'bring', 'character', 'extremely', 'large', 'ark', 'amazing', 'br', 'stated', 'earlier', 'lambert', 'fan', 'highlander', 'hunted', 'fortress', 'film', 'good', 'shame', 'got', 'chance', 'portray', 'character', 'depth', 'br', 'short', 'story', 'way', 'long', 'little', 'disappointed', 'film', 'good', 'glad', 'lambert', 'good', 'regret', 'staying']","['remember', 'see', 'film', 'theater', 'year', 'old', 'math', 'absolutely', 'love', 'tarzan', 'week', 'see', 'climb', 'furniture', 'jump', 'make', 'monkey', 'sound', 'start', 'fascination', 'tarzan', 'monkey', 'oddly', 'long', 'last', 'love', 'christopher', 'lambert', 'mind', 'see', 'highland', 'shortly', 'time', 'see', 'film', 'month', 'ago', 'happen', 'cable', 'get', 'ready', 'bed', 'late', 'tired', 'work', 'stay', 'watch', 'movie', 'love', 'kid', 'br', 'view', 'realize', 'great', 'film', 'odder', 'andie', 'macdowell', 'voice', 'dub', 'ian', 'holme', 'course', 'solid', 'usual', 'surprisingly', 'monkey', 'suit', 'kind', 'hold', 'surprising', 'good', 'lambert', 'tarzan', 'great', 'depth', 'manage', 'capture', 'line', 'primal', 'body', 'language', 'importantly', 'ability', 'bring', 'character', 'extremely', 'large', 'ark', 'amazing', 'br', 'state', 'early', 'lambert', 'fan', 'highlander', 'hunted', 'fortress', 'film', 'good', 'shame', 'get', 'chance', 'portray', 'character', 'depth', 'br', 'short', 'story', 'way', 'long', 'little', 'disappointed', 'film', 'good', 'glad', 'lambert', 'good', 'regret', 'stay']"
"A family is traveling through the mid West. There's widower Ben (Charles Bateman), his girlfriend Nicky (Ahna Capri) and Ben's little daughter K.T. (Geri Reischl). Then hit a town named Hillsboro where everyone acts more than a little strangely. Their car breaks down and they're forced to stay. They soon find out a witches coven has a spell over the town and is up to incredible evil.<br /><br />The story is not that good. People just figure things out of nothing and they just happen to find out where the witches are at the end. Also there are a lot of loopholes left dangling at the end. The acting is pretty poor too. Bateman and Capri are bland and everybody else is about the same. Only old pros Strother Martin and L.Q. Jones give good performances. Still this movie does work. It forgoes blood and gore (there's some but this is PG) and manges to work with some very creepy visuals and atmosphere. The acting hampers a lot of it but it still works. Martin especially chews the scenery in his role. I can't explain exactly why I (sort of) like this movie but it did work on me. It's a quiet kind of horror that isn't made anymore.

"Francis Ford Coppola wrote and directed this stunningly personal story of a married woman's flight from her husband--and the reality that perhaps the youthful glee and excitement of her younger years are behind her. We learn little about this woman's marriage except that she has been feeling her independence slipping away as of late; she's also recently learned she's pregnant, which has further complicated her heart (she doesn't want to be a complacent wifey, despite the maternal way she speaks to her husband over the phone). She meets two men on her journey: a former college football hero who--after an accident during a game--has been left with permanent brain damage, and a sexy, strutting motorcycle cop who has a great deal of trouble in his own life. The clear, clean landscapes (as photographed by the very talented Wilmer Butler) are astutely realized, as are the characters. Shirley Knight, James Caan, and Robert Duvall each deliver strong, gripping performances, most especially since these are not very likable people in conventional terms. Some scenes (such as Knight's first call home from a pay-phone, or her first night alone with Caan where they play 'Simon Says') are almost too intimate to watch. Coppola toys with reality, turning the jagged memories of his characters into scrapbooks we've been made privy to. He allows scenes to play out, yet the editing is quite nimble and the film is never allowed to get too heavy (there are at least two or three very frisky moments). It's a heady endeavor--so much so that the picture was still being shown at festivals nearly five years later. Some may shun Coppola's unapologetic twisting of events in order to underline the finale with bitter irony, however the forcefulness and drive behind the picture nearly obliterate its shortcomings. *** from ****",francis ford coppola wrote and directed this stunningly personal story of a married woman's flight from her husband--and the reality that perhaps the youthful glee and excitement of her younger years are behind her we learn little about this woman's marriage except that she has been feeling her independence slipping away as of late; she's also recently learned she's pregnant which has further complicated her heart (she doesn't want to be a complacent wifey despite the maternal way she speaks to her husband over the phone) she meets two men on her journey: a former college football hero who--after an accident during a game--has been left with permanent brain damage and a sexy strutting motorcycle cop who has a great deal of trouble in his own life the clear clean landscapes (as photographed by the very talented wilmer butler) are astutely realized as are the characters shirley knight james caan and robert duvall each deliver strong gripping performances most especially since these are not very likable people in conventional terms some scenes (such as knight's first call home from a pay-phone or her first night alone with caan where they play 'simon says') are almost too intimate to watch coppola toys with reality turning the jagged memories of his characters into scrapbooks we've been made privy to he allows scenes to play out yet the editing is quite nimble and the film is never allowed to get too heavy (there are at least two or three very frisky moments) it's a heady endeavor--so much so that the picture was still being shown at festivals nearly five years later some may shun coppola's unapologetic twisting of events in order to underline the finale with bitter irony however the forcefulness and drive behind the picture nearly obliterate its shortcomings *** from ****,"['francis', 'ford', 'coppola', 'wrote', 'directed', 'stunningly', 'personal', 'story', 'married', 'woman', 'flight', 'husband', 'reality', 'youthful', 'glee', 'excitement', 'younger', 'years', 'learn', 'little', 'woman', 'marriage', 'feeling', 'independence', 'slipping', 'away', 'late', 'recently', 'learned', 'pregnant', 'complicated', 'heart', 'want', 'complacent', 'wifey', 'despite', 'maternal', 'way', 'speaks', 'husband', 'phone', 'meets', 'men', 'journey', 'college', 'football', 'hero', 'accident', 'game', 'left', 'permanent', 'brain', 'damage', 'sexy', 'strutting', 'motorcycle', 'cop', 'great', 'deal', 'trouble', 'life', 'clear', 'clean', 'landscapes', 'photographed', 'talented', 'wilmer', 'butler', 'astutely', 'realized', 'characters', 'shirley', 'knight', 'james', 'caan', 'robert', 'duvall', 'deliver', 'strong', 'gripping', 'performances', 'especially', 'likable', 'people', 'conventional', 'terms', 'scenes', 'knight', 'home', 'pay', 'phone', 'night', 'caan', 'play', 'simon', 'says', 'intimate', 'watch', 'coppola', 'toys', 'reality', 'turning', 'jagged', 'memories', 'characters', 'scrapbooks', 'privy', 'allows', 'scenes', 'play', 'editing', 'nimble', 'film', 'allowed', 'heavy', 'frisky', 'moments', 'heady', 'endeavor', 'picture', 'shown', 'festivals', 'nearly', 'years', 'later', 'shun', 'coppola', 'unapologetic', 'twisting', 'events', 'order', 'underline', 'finale', 'bitter', 'irony', 'forcefulness', 'drive', 'picture', 'nearly', 'obliterate', 'shortcomings']","['francis', 'ford', 'coppola', 'write', 'direct', 'stunningly', 'personal', 'story', 'married', 'woman', 'flight', 'husband', 'reality', 'youthful', 'glee', 'excitement', 'young', 'year', 'learn', 'little', 'woman', 'marriage', 'feel', 'independence', 'slip', 'away', 'late', 'recently', 'learn', 'pregnant', 'complicate', 'heart', 'want', 'complacent', 'wifey', 'despite', 'maternal', 'way', 'speak', 'husband', 'phone', 'meet', 'man', 'journey', 'college', 'football', 'hero', 'accident', 'game', 'leave', 'permanent', 'brain', 'damage', 'sexy', 'strutting', 'motorcycle', 'cop', 'great', 'deal', 'trouble', 'life', 'clear', 'clean', 'landscape', 'photograph', 'talented', 'wilmer', 'butler', 'astutely', 'realize', 'character', 'shirley', 'knight', 'james', 'caan', 'robert', 'duvall', 'deliver', 'strong', 'gripping', 'performance', 'especially', 'likable', 'people', 'conventional', 'term', 'scene', 'knight', 'home', 'pay', 'phone', 'night', 'caan', 'play', 'simon', 'say', 'intimate', 'watch', 'coppola', 'toy', 'reality', 'turn', 'jagged', 'memory', 'character', 'scrapbook', 'privy', 'allow', 'scene', 'play', 'editing', 'nimble', 'film', 'allow', 'heavy', 'frisky', 'moment', 'heady', 'endeavor', 'picture', 'show', 'festival', 'nearly', 'year', 'later', 'shun', 'coppola', 'unapologetic', 'twisting', 'event', 'order', 'underline', 'finale', 'bitter', 'irony', 'forcefulness', 'drive', 'picture', 'nearly', 'obliterate', 'shortcoming']"
This movie was not very well directed. they almost totally disregarded the book.I guess they were trying 2 save time. the only upside 2 me was that the actor who played finny was cute. Some of the dialog between the main characters appeared a little gay which was not the case in the book. Major parts of the book were once again chopped out.You lost the over all effect it was not as haunting as the book and left me lacking severely. Also the strong language although it was brief was very unnecessary. Also i was surprised ( not pleasantly) by a new character that was no where in the book.One of my favorite characters (leper) was poorly interpreted and portrayed. He seemed more sinister in the movie than the real leper was in the book.

"The buzz for this film has always been about the fabulous graphics that make Kevin Bacon disappear. Sadly, they stopped there. They should have continued to make the script disappear, then the silly set, and finally every visible element of this film. Because, there's nothing else there to show.<br /><br />Gary Thompson and Andrew Marlowe are listed as the writing credits for this film. I don't really think they exist. I think they bought this script at ""Scripts-R-Us"", where you buy a standard blank ""Monster Movie"" script and just fill in the blanks. There's a monster stalking us. Let's split up. (They actually ""let's split up"" in this movie). Hit Alien/Giant-bug/Monster/Invisible-man with crowbar. Not dead yet. Burn Huge-rabbit/Shark/Invisible-man in unsurvivable fire. Not dead yet. You know, the standard stuff. Even the minimum number of elements that were specific to an invisible man movie (IR glasses, spraying with something like paint) were handled badly. <br /><br />What is sad is that there were lots of possibilities for this to be a fascinating movie. They psychological issues for the subject, the deterioration of the mind due to the process, treating an invisible subject, and many other ideas were touched on for usually less than 2 seconds and would have been far more interesting. Had there been any desire to save Kevin Bacon in the end, it would have been a much better movie. All in all, it stunk.<br /><br />I would mention some of the incredibly stupid elements of the ending of the movie, but I don't want to do any spoilers.

"A young girl becomes a war-time marine's pen-pal, and when he visits at war's end expecting someone a bit more ""available,"" comic complications ensue. All ultimately works out well, naturally, but not before everyone involved has thoroughly chewed the scenery. Errol Flynn's dead-on impression of Humphrey Bogart from ""Casablanca"" is a highlight, as are various send-ups of his own swashbuckling image (the ""jumping"" scene in the kitchen with Forrest Tucker is a riot). It is Tucker, though, who ""tucks"" the movie under his arm, lowers his head and barrels over the goal line. He demonstrates the comic flair more fully developed twenty years later in ""F-Troop"" and imparts a liveliness and energy that Flynn repeatedly plays off to raise his own performance. Eleanor Parker does a fine job as the woman being pursued, and little Patti Brady charms as Tucker's actual pen-pal friend. A fine, lightweight ""coming home"" comedy in a genteel setting that children and romantics of all ages should find entertaining.","a young girl becomes a war-time marine's pen-pal and when he visits at war's end expecting someone a bit more ""available"" comic complications ensue all ultimately works out well naturally but not before everyone involved has thoroughly chewed the scenery errol flynn's dead-on impression of humphrey bogart from ""casablanca"" is a highlight as are various send-ups of his own swashbuckling image (the ""jumping"" scene in the kitchen with forrest tucker is a riot) it is tucker though who ""tucks"" the movie under his arm lowers his head and barrels over the goal line he demonstrates the comic flair more fully developed twenty years later in ""f-troop"" and imparts a liveliness and energy that flynn repeatedly plays off to raise his own performance eleanor parker does a fine job as the woman being pursued and little patti brady charms as tucker's actual pen-pal friend a fine lightweight ""coming home"" comedy in a genteel setting that children and romantics of all ages should find entertaining","['young', 'girl', 'war', 'time', 'marine', 'pen', 'pal', 'visits', 'war', 'end', 'expecting', 'bit', 'available', 'comic', 'complications', 'ensue', 'ultimately', 'works', 'naturally', 'involved', 'thoroughly', 'chewed', 'scenery', 'errol', 'flynn', 'dead', 'impression', 'humphrey', 'bogart', 'casablanca', 'highlight', 'send', 'ups', 'swashbuckling', 'image', 'jumping', 'scene', 'kitchen', 'forrest', 'tucker', 'riot', 'tucker', 'tucks', 'movie', 'arm', 'lowers', 'head', 'barrels', 'goal', 'line', 'demonstrates', 'comic', 'flair', 'fully', 'developed', 'years', 'later', 'f', 'troop', 'imparts', 'liveliness', 'energy', 'flynn', 'repeatedly', 'plays', 'raise', 'performance', 'eleanor', 'parker', 'fine', 'job', 'woman', 'pursued', 'little', 'patti', 'brady', 'charms', 'tucker', 'actual', 'pen', 'pal', 'friend', 'fine', 'lightweight', 'coming', 'home', 'comedy', 'genteel', 'setting', 'children', 'romantics', 'ages', 'find', 'entertaining']","['young', 'girl', 'war', 'time', 'marine', 'pen', 'pal', 'visit', 'war', 'end', 'expect', 'bit', 'available', 'comic', 'complication', 'ensue', 'ultimately', 'work', 'naturally', 'involve', 'thoroughly', 'chew', 'scenery', 'errol', 'flynn', 'dead', 'impression', 'humphrey', 'bogart', 'casablanca', 'highlight', 'send', 'up', 'swashbuckling', 'image', 'jumping', 'scene', 'kitchen', 'forr', 'tucker', 'riot', 'tucker', 'tuck', 'movie', 'arm', 'lower', 'head', 'barrel', 'goal', 'line', 'demonstrate', 'comic', 'flair', 'fully', 'develop', 'year', 'later', 'f', 'troop', 'impart', 'liveliness', 'energy', 'flynn', 'repeatedly', 'play', 'raise', 'performance', 'eleanor', 'parker', 'fine', 'job', 'woman', 'pursue', 'little', 'patti', 'brady', 'charm', 'tucker', 'actual', 'pen', 'pal', 'friend', 'fine', 'lightweight', 'come', 'home', 'comedy', 'genteel', 'setting', 'child', 'romantic', 'age', 'find', 'entertain']"

It was a cheap soft porn of the Bollywood lovers, where Mallika showed a lot more skin than anyone dared to show. Emran did more roles like this and was even nicknamed the serial killer. In the future if the Indian Directors plan to remake a English movie then they have to look into the feasibility of the plot with the Indian Censors.

"Robert Altman's downbeat, new-fangled western from Edmund Naughton's book ""McCabe"" was overlooked at the time of its release but in the past years has garnered a sterling critical following. Aside from a completely convincing boom-town scenario, the characters here don't merit much interest, and the picture looks (intentionally) brackish and unappealing. Bearded Warren Beatty plays a turn-of-the-century entrepreneur who settles in struggling community on the outskirts of nowhere and helps organize the first brothel; once the profits start coming in, Beatty is naturally menaced by city toughs who want part of the action. Altman creates a solemn, wintry atmosphere for the movie which gives the audience a certain sense of time and place, but the action in this sorry little town is limited--most of the story being made up of vignettes--and Altman's pacing is deliberately slow. There's hardly a statement being made (just the opposite, in fact) and the languid actors stare at each other without much on their minds. It's a self-defeating picture, and yet, in an Altman-quirky way, it wears defeat proudly. ** from ****","robert altman's downbeat new-fangled western from edmund naughton's book ""mccabe"" was overlooked at the time of its release but in the past years has garnered a sterling critical following aside from a completely convincing boom-town scenario the characters here don't merit much interest and the picture looks (intentionally) brackish and unappealing bearded warren beatty plays a turn-of-the-century entrepreneur who settles in struggling community on the outskirts of nowhere and helps organize the first brothel; once the profits start coming in beatty is naturally menaced by city toughs who want part of the action altman creates a solemn wintry atmosphere for the movie which gives the audience a certain sense of time and place but the action in this sorry little town is limited--most of the story being made up of vignettes--and altman's pacing is deliberately slow there's hardly a statement being made (just the opposite in fact) and the languid actors stare at each other without much on their minds it's a self-defeating picture and yet in an altman-quirky way it wears defeat proudly ** from ****","['robert', 'altman', 'downbeat', 'new', 'fangled', 'western', 'edmund', 'naughton', 'book', 'mccabe', 'overlooked', 'time', 'release', 'past', 'years', 'garnered', 'sterling', 'critical', 'following', 'aside', 'completely', 'convincing', 'boom', 'town', 'scenario', 'characters', 'merit', 'interest', 'picture', 'looks', 'intentionally', 'brackish', 'unappealing', 'bearded', 'warren', 'beatty', 'plays', 'turn', 'century', 'entrepreneur', 'settles', 'struggling', 'community', 'outskirts', 'helps', 'organize', 'brothel', 'profits', 'start', 'coming', 'beatty', 'naturally', 'menaced', 'city', 'toughs', 'want', 'action', 'altman', 'creates', 'solemn', 'wintry', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'gives', 'audience', 'certain', 'sense', 'time', 'place', 'action', 'sorry', 'little', 'town', 'limited', 'story', 'vignettes', 'altman', 'pacing', 'deliberately', 'slow', 'hardly', 'statement', 'opposite', 'fact', 'languid', 'actors', 'stare', 'minds', 'self', 'defeating', 'picture', 'altman', 'quirky', 'way', 'wears', 'defeat', 'proudly']","['robert', 'altman', 'downbeat', 'new', 'fangled', 'western', 'edmund', 'naughton', 'book', 'mccabe', 'overlook', 'time', 'release', 'past', 'year', 'garner', 'sterling', 'critical', 'follow', 'aside', 'completely', 'convincing', 'boom', 'town', 'scenario', 'character', 'merit', 'interest', 'picture', 'look', 'intentionally', 'brackish', 'unappeale', 'bearded', 'warren', 'beatty', 'play', 'turn', 'century', 'entrepreneur', 'settle', 'struggle', 'community', 'outskirt', 'help', 'organize', 'brothel', 'profit', 'start', 'come', 'beatty', 'naturally', 'menace', 'city', 'tough', 'want', 'action', 'altman', 'create', 'solemn', 'wintry', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'give', 'audience', 'certain', 'sense', 'time', 'place', 'action', 'sorry', 'little', 'town', 'limited', 'story', 'vignette', 'altman', 'pacing', 'deliberately', 'slow', 'hardly', 'statement', 'opposite', 'fact', 'languid', 'actor', 'stare', 'mind', 'self', 'defeat', 'picture', 'altman', 'quirky', 'way', 'wear', 'defeat', 'proudly']"

These two guys just didn't belong together from their first ambiguous encounter. As much as Mathieu and Cedric were sexually attracted to each other, the absence of a deeper emotional tie made it impossible for Mathieu, an intellectual being, to find fulfillment in sharing life with someone whose sensibilities were more attuned to carnival festivities and romps on the beach.<br /><br />On a purely technical note, I loved the camera action in this film.

"From the film's first shot - Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet wandering reading through a field at dawn, thus invoking all the clichés cinema has developed to address the phenomenon of the strong-minded rebellious female character in period drama - I knew I was in for something to make me want to kill myself.<br /><br />Joe Wright seemed not only to have not read the book, but to be under the regrettable misapprehension that what he was filming was not in fact Jane Austen's subtle, nuanced comedy of manners conducted through sparkling, delicate social interaction in eighteenth century English drawing-rooms, but a sort of U-certificate Wuthering Heights. Thus we were treated to every scene between Elizabeth and Darcy taking place outside for no apparent reason, in inappropriately rugged scenery and often in the pouring rain. Not to mention that Jane Austen, and in particular P & P, is not about passion, sexual tension or love. It's about different strategies of negotiating the stultification of eighteenth century society. Which was completely ignored, so that the Bennets' house was a rambunctious, chaotic place where everybody shouts at once, runs around, leaves their underwear on chairs, and pigs wander happily through the house; the society balls become rowdy country dances one step away from a Matrix Reloaded style dance-orgy; and everybody says exactly what they think without the slightest regard for propriety.<br /><br />The genius of Jane Austen lies in exploring the void created by a society in which nobody says what they think or mean because of an overwhelming regard for propriety, and the tragic predicaments of her characters arise from misunderstandings and miscommunications enabled by that speechless gap. So both the brilliance of Jane Austen and the very factor that allows her plots - particularly in this film - to function was completely erased. Subtlety in general was nowhere int his film, sacrificed in favour of an overwrought drama which jarred entirely with the material and the performances.<br /><br />It was so obviously trying to be a *serious* film. The humour - which IS Pride & Prejudice, both Austen's methodology and her appeal - was almost entirely suppressed in favour of all this po-faced melodrama, and when it was allowed in, was handled so clumsily. Pride & Prejudice is a serious narrative which makes serious points, yes, but those serious points and weightier themes are not just intertwined with the humour, they are embedded in it. You can't lose Jane Austen's technique, leaving only the bare bones of the story, and expect the themes to remain. Not even when you replace her techniques with your own heavy-handed mystical-numinous fauxbrow cinematography.<br /><br />Elizabeth Bennett is supposed to be a woman, an adult, mature and sensible and clear-sighted. Keira Knightley played the first half of the film like an empty-headed giggling schoolgirl, and the second half like an empty-headed schoolgirl who thinks she is a tragic heroine. Elizabeth's wit, her combative verbal exchanges, her quintessential characteristic of being able to see and laugh at everybody's follies including her own, her strength and composure, and her fantastic clear-sightedness were completely lost and replaced with ... what? A lot of giggling and staring into the distance? Rather than being able to keep her head when all about her were losing theirs, she started to cry and scream at the slightest provocation - and not genuinely raging, either; no, these were petulant hissy fits. And where the great strength of Austen's Elizabeth (at least in Austen's eyes) was her ability to retain integrity and observance while remaining within the boundaries of society and sustaining impeachable propriety, Knightley's Elizabeth had no regard whatsoever for convention. Furthermore, she seemed to think that wandering around barefoot in the mud in the eighteenth century version of overalls established her beyond doubt as spirited and strong-minded, and therefore nothing in the character as written or the performance had to sustain it. An astonishingly unsubtle and bland performance. In which quest for blandness and weakness, she was ably matched by Matthew Macfayden.<br /><br />Donald Sutherland as Mr Bennet seemed weak, ineffectual and permanently befuddled without the wicked sense of humour and ironic detachment at the expense of human relationships that makes Mr Bennet so fascinating and tragic. His special bond with Lizzie, as the only two sensible people in a world of fools, was completely lost, not least because both of them were fools in a world of fools, and that completely deprived the end of the film of emotional impact. Mr Bingley was no longer amiable and well-meaning to the point of folly, but was played as a complete retard for cheap laughs, and the woman who was playing Jane was so wildly inconsistent that she may as well not have tried to do anything with the character at all. The script veered wildly between verbatim chunks of Jane Austen - delivered with remarkable clumsiness - and totally contemporaneous language which would not be out of place in a modern day romantic comedy.<br /><br />Just get the BBC adaptation on DVD and save yourself the heartache.",from the film's first shot - keira knightley as elizabeth bennet wandering reading through a field at dawn thus invoking all the clichs cinema has developed to address the phenomenon of the strong-minded rebellious female character in period drama - i knew i was in for something to make me want to kill myself<br /><br />joe wright seemed not only to have not read the book but to be under the regrettable misapprehension that what he was filming was not in fact jane austen's subtle nuanced comedy of manners conducted through sparkling delicate social interaction in eighteenth century english drawing-rooms but a sort of u-certificate wuthering heights thus we were treated to every scene between elizabeth and darcy taking place outside for no apparent reason in inappropriately rugged scenery and often in the pouring rain not to mention that jane austen and in particular p & p is not about passion sexual tension or love it's about different strategies of negotiating the stultification of eighteenth century society which was completely ignored so that the bennets' house was a

"I've always enjoyed films that depict life as it is. Life sometimes has boring patches, no real plot, and not necessarily a happy ending.

Life ebbs and flows like a river, and it has it's rough spots, but it is a wonderful trip.<br /><br />Robert Redford brings a lot to the film. His narration has a friendly feel that fits the picture perfectly. As a director, he is restrained and calm, and captures some incredibly beautiful scenes. As for the acting, Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt work surprising well as brothers. I don't know quite how to describe Tom Skerritt and Brenda Blethyn's performances, except that they truly feel real.

"The story is very trustworthy and powerful. The technical side of the movie is quite fine.. even the directing of it.

The role of the elder Blind girl, played by Taly Sharon, was fresh but without any intensity as the leading role. therefore the figure she acted had become mild and low profile.

"You know that mouthwash commercial where the guy has a mouth full of Listerine or whatever it is and he's trying really hard to keep from spitting it up into the sink? That's a great metaphor for this movie. I kept watching, even though it was really difficult. But keeping mouthwash in your mouth will leave you with a minty fresh feeling. This movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I should have spit it out when I had the chance.<br /><br />The premise is corny enough to be fun. For the first time in like a thousand years, Gargoyles have returned to Romania, and all of the priests who knew how to fight and kill these things are long dead. It's up to Michael Pare and some other secret agents to get to the bottom of things before the Gargoyles run amok. Unfortunately, the premise is completely lost in bad dialog and less than enthusiastic acting on the part of the human leads.

"This is one of a rarity of movies, where instead of a bowl of popcorn one should watch it with a bottle of vodka. To be completely honest we are a group of people who actually know the man, Mo Ogrodnik, and decided to drink ourselves stupid to this film.<br /><br />The cinematic aspect of Wolfgang Something's photography seems to have left out both close-ups and breasts. Mo and Wolfgang's collaborative effort revealed the passion of the two actresses, plastic peens holding passion. There's also beetle banging. As Violet would have put it: ""This (plastic peen) goes up your butt"". The rat porn and subsequent rat smashing is awesome. <br /><br />Alright. So if you are still reading, let us explain who we are. Mo Ogrodnik teaches at NYU and we are a group of her students, who, finishing a film class with her, decided to get poop- faced and watch here directorial debut. She also wrote Uptown Girls. I can't tell you how much that's been hammered into our skulls. So this movie is quite the experience. At the very bottom of this post will be a drinking game we created for this movie. <br /><br />About 13 minutes into this game, none of us could see straight. The sheer amount of Dido's in the first thirty minutes created enough reasons to drink to pacify an elephant.There was something secretly pleasurable about seeing two underage girls hit on a Kurt Cobain lookalike with absolutely no context, save for his mysterious scene at the convenience store where he was oh-so-naturally reading a local newspaper. Because that's what we all do. The heart-shaped glasses were delightfully derivative of Lolita. And something about that provocative scene of the nude chin-up boy suggests the director's history of homosexual pornographic experiments. We wish we were kidding.<br /><br />Enough intellectual contemplation. ON TO THE DRINKING GAME! This will ensure that the viewing experience is a positive one. It's very simple, and very likely to send at least one member of your party to immediate care.<br /><br />The Mo Ogrodnik/Ripe Drinking Game: 1. Every time you see anything related to pornography, take a drink. 2. Every time you see auteur Mo Ogrodnik's name appear, take a drink. 3. Sex. 4. (plastic peen) require two drinks. 5. Any time somebody points a gun at another character, take a drink. -At this point you will probably need to refill/pee pee any remaining sobriety from your body.- 6. Any time there is blood (INCLUDING ""LADY BLOOD""), please take a sip! 7. The underused hula-hoop girl requires one drink per second. 8. Gratuitous use of the ""magic black man"" requires one drink. 9. If you can't figure out the through-line, KEEP DRINKING, Beyotch. 10. Whenever you are able to predict a line, take a drink. Trust us. It's easy. <br /><br />That's it, internet!

"Even though I'm quite young, The Beatles are my ABSOLUTELY FAVOURITE band! I never had the chance to hear their music as it was releases but have loved them since I can remember.<br /><br />It's the sort of film that is worth trying the once. I can see why it wasn't released in the cinema but it is certainly a great film to put on the TV. I was flicking through my TV guide and happened to see this film, it didn't much details except something like, 'John Lennon and Paul McCartney meet after The Beatles have broken up, Jared Harris Stars'. I'd never heard of him (he played John) or Aiden Quinn who played Paul. However they are certainly underestimated actors!<br /><br />The film had a slow start but as it developed, I could see how well Quinn but especially Harris played their characters. As a huge fan, I sort of know what the real Lennon and McCartney are like. The script was brilliant and Harris got Lennon's accent, personality and mannerisms spot on! Quinn played McCartney quite well but sometimes went into his Irish accent. THe make-up artists made them look excellent.<br /><br />THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE COUNTED AS A *SPOILER*:<br /><br />As I mentioned before, it got off to a slow start but soon developed and became quite an emotional film. I found the bit in the park a total waste of time and quite out of character for both of the musicians. As for Lennon's rude line in the Italian restaurant, totally unnecessary. The ending was very poignant and brings a tear to my eye whenever I watch it.<br /><br />It is quite different from the other biographical films I've seen where it's about how The Beatles got together and became famous, and those never really did the characters that well. E.g. 'Backbeat'.<br /><br />In conclusion, I would say, if you're a Beatles or John Lennon or Paul McCartney fan, give it a chance you may have pleasent surprise. At only about 95 minutes long, it's worth waiting for the film to develop.<br /><br />If anyone does know whether the meeting of 1976 really did happen please send it to the 'comments page' for this film, I'd be very interested.",even though i'm quite young the beatles are my absolutely favourite band i never had the chance to hear their music as it was releases but have loved them since i can

"This is just one more of those hideous films that you find on Lifetime TV which portray the abhorrent behavior of some disgusting woman in an empathetic manner. Along with other such nasty films as ""The Burning Bed,"" ""Enough,"" or ""Monster,"" this film takes a disgusting criminal and attempts to show the viewer why she's not such a bad person after all. Give us a break! Here's my question to the filmmakers: If LeTourneau were a man, and Vili were a 12 year old girl, would you have made a picture sympathizing and empathizing with this person? Answer: Hell no.<br /><br />Imagine switching the genders in this film, and then you'll see just why myself and others here consider this a worthless piece of garbage. Were the genders switched, there would be no attempt to empathize with the criminal. Instead, we'd likely be treated to a portrayal of a monstrous and hideous man preying upon a young girl, his lascivious behavior landing him in prison, and his brainwashed victim suffering from Stockholm Syndrome. The only reason LeTourneau does not receive the same treatment in this film is by virtue of her sex.<br /><br />Let's call a spade a spade. LeTourneau is a pedophile. Plain and simple. No ifs, ands or buts. She's a criminal who belongs in prison, and deserves our derision and contempt, but certainly not our pity or empathy.","this is just one more of those hideous films that you find on lifetime tv which portray the abhorrent behavior of some disgusting woman in an empathetic manner along with other such nasty films as ""the burning bed"" ""enough"" or ""monster"" this film takes a disgusting criminal and attempts to show the viewer why she's not such a bad person after all give us a break here's my question to the filmmakers: if letourneau were a man and vili were a 12 year old girl would you have made a picture sympathizing and empathizing with this person answer: hell no<br /><br />imagine switching the genders in this film and then you'll see just why myself and others here consider this a worthless piece of garbage were the genders switched there would be no attempt to empathize with the criminal instead we'd likely be treated to a portrayal of a monstrous and hideous man preying upon a young girl his lascivious behavior landing him in prison and his brainwashed victim suffering from stockholm syndrome the only reason letourneau does not receive the same treatment in this film is by virtue of her sex<br /><br />let's call a spade a spade letourneau is a pedophile plain and simple no ifs ands or buts she's a criminal who belongs in prison and deserves our derision and contempt but certainly not our pity or empathy","['hideous', 'films', 'find', 'lifetime', 'tv', 'portray', 'abhorrent', 'behavior', 'disgusting', 'woman', 'empathetic', 'manner', 'nasty', 'films', 'burning', 'bed', 'monster', 'film', 'takes', 'disgusting', 'criminal', 'attempts', 'viewer', 'bad', 'person', 'break', 'question', 'filmmakers', 'letourneau', 'man', 'vili', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'picture', 'sympathizing', 'empathizing', 'person', 'answer', 'hell', 'br', 'switching', 'genders', 'film', 'consider', 'worthless', 'piece', 'garbage', 'genders', 'switched', 'attempt', 'empathize', 'criminal', 'instead', 'likely', 'treated', 'portrayal', 'monstrous', 'hideous', 'man', 'preying', 'young', 'girl', 'lascivious', 'behavior', 'landing', 'prison', 'brainwashed', 'victim', 'suffering', 'stockholm', 'syndrome', 'reason', 'letourneau', 'receive', 'treatment', 'film', 'virtue', 'sex', 'br', 'spade', 'spade', 'letourneau', 'pedophile', 'plain', 'simple', 'ifs', 'ands', 'buts', 'criminal', 'belongs', 'prison', 'deserves', 'derision', 'contempt', 'certainly', 'pity', 'empathy']","['hideous', 'film', 'find', 'lifetime', 'tv', 'portray', 'abhorrent', 'behavior', 'disgusting', 'woman', 'empathetic', 'manner', 'nasty', 'film', 'burn', 'bed', 'monster', 'film', 'take', 'disgusting', 'criminal', 'attempt', 'viewer', 'bad', 'person', 'break', 'question', 'filmmaker', 'letourneau', 'man', 'vili', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'picture', 'sympathize', 'empathize', 'person', 'answer', 'hell', 'br', 'switch', 'gender', 'film', 'consider', 'worthless', 'piece', 'garbage', 'gender', 'switch', 'attempt', 'empathize', 'criminal', 'instead', 'likely', 'treat', 'portrayal', 'monstrous', 'hideous', 'man', 'preying', 'young', 'girl', 'lascivious', 'behavior', 'land', 'prison', 'brainwash', 'victim', 'suffer', 'stockholm', 'syndrome', 'reason', 'letourneau', 'receive', 'treatment', 'film', 'virtue', 'sex', 'br', 'spade', 'spade', 'letourneau', 'pedophile', 'plain', 'simple', 'ifs', 'and', 'but', 'criminal', 'belong', 'prison', 'deserve', 'derision', 'contempt', 'certainly', 'pity', 'empathy']"
"The premise of this movie was decent enough, but with sub par acting, it was just bland and dull.<br /><br />SPOILERS The film does not work because of the nature of the death, it was accidental, so although it was a murder it wasn't like the guy set out to do it. Also through some flashbacks there is a secret that is revealed that sort of makes the events like justice to a degree. There is no emotion in this film.

"The Lives of the Saints starts off with an atmospheric vision of London as a bustling city of busy, quaint streets and sunshine. I was hoping it would maintain this atmosphere, but it gets bogged down in a story that goes pretty much nowhere.<br /><br />Othello works for big, fat Mr. Karva, his crime-boss step-dad (at least I think that is what he is supposed to be because it's never really defined, but he does drop kittens into deep fat friers, so trust me, he's a prick) doing scrappy little errands while his skanky girlfriend gives daddy hand-jobs. One of his colleagues is Runner, a black dude who is always dashing from A to B. Until the day he comes across almost mute homeless child who grants him his wish of being able to stop running. Runner dumps the lost boy in Othello's flat, where he promptly starts granting more wishes. Keen to have some of his own desires fulfilled, Karva has the boy kidnapped. But he isn't sure of what would really bring him happiness. Is it the innocence of being a child again or is it another hand-job? Either way, I don't want to see the little boy grant him the second.<br /><br />It just takes ages to get going and there are loads of repetitive scenes. The ending tries to be shocking but since there's hardly any back-story on investment in any of these characters it only serves as a release for the bored audience.<br /><br />Writer Tony Grisoni, a favourite of Terry Gilliam, tries to blend in some kind of religious allegory which ends up being pretentious as all hell, ironically. If he gave us something more accessible or at least had better explanations for the characters suddenly acting all weird then it would have been a more enjoyable film. As it is, we are introduced to a bunch of annoying loudmouths who then miraculously seem to develop intelligence when confronted by the mysterious boy. Who's origins are never revealed. That's just plain irritating! <br /><br />Aside from sporadic moments of atmosphere and a moody score, this film has little to recommend.",the lives of the saints starts off with an atmospheric vision

"I can't emphasize it enough, do *NOT* get this movie for the kids.<br /><br />For that matter, you'd best spare the adults from it as well.<br /><br />All right, perhaps I'm overexaggerating a little.

This isn't the worst movie made by dissilusioned adults FOR dissilusioned adults and somehow marketed towards kids (that would be ""Jack"", which I've been meaning to review / gut like a fish).<br /><br />Adults won't learn anything surprising (well, if you must, fast-forward to just before the end credits for a Educational Bit about an Interesting Cosmic Phenominon). We don't usually end up doing as adults what we wanted to do as kids as reality tends to get in the way. Well, duh, I could have told you that (so can four years of college at an art school, but I degress).<br /><br />I have no idea what the heck kids could possibly get out of this movie. Most likely it will only upset them (we get to watch the moment when Russ was traumatized at eight years old). There's a better movie, ""Kiki's Delivery Service"", that has essentially the same message but handles it litely instead of drilling it into your head. And the adults will like it too!<br /><br />By the way, there is a moment in the movie made with amature MST3K-ers in mind, if they think of that OTHER Bruce Willis movie with a sad little kid in it.","i can't emphasize it enough do *not* get this movie for the kids<br /><br />for that matter you'd best spare the adults from it as well<br /><br />all right perhaps i'm overexaggerating a little this isn't the worst kids' movie no let me rephrase that this isn't the worst movie made by dissilusioned adults for dissilusioned adults and somehow marketed towards kids (that would be ""jack"" which i've been meaning to review / gut like a fish)<br /><br />adults won't learn anything surprising (well if you must fast-forward to just before the end credits for a educational bit about an interesting cosmic phenominon) we don't usually end up doing as adults what we wanted to do as kids as reality tends to get in the way well duh i could have told you that (so can four years of college at an art school but i degress)<br /><br />i have no idea what the heck kids could possibly get out of this movie most likely it will only upset them (we get to watch the moment when russ was traumatized at eight years old) there's a better movie ""kiki's delivery service"" that has essentially the same message but handles it litely instead of drilling it into your head and the adults will like it too<br /><br />by the way there is a moment in the movie made with amature mst3k-ers in mind if they think of that other bruce willis movie with a sad little kid in it","['emphasize', 'movie', 'kids', 'br', 'matter', 'best', 'spare', 'adults', 'br', 'right', 'overexaggerating', 'little', 'worst', 'kids', 'movie', 'let', 'rephrase', 'worst', 'movie', 'dissilusioned', 'adults', 'dissilusioned', 'adults', 'marketed', 'kids', 'jack', 'meaning', 'review', 'gut', 'like', 'wo', 'learn', 'surprising', 'fast', 'forward', 'end', 'credits', 'educational', 'bit', 'interesting', 'cosmic', 'phenominon', 'usually', 'end', 'adults', 'wanted', 'kids', 'reality', 'tends', 'way', 'duh', 'told', 'years', 'college', 'art', 'school', 'idea', 'heck', 'kids', 'possibly', 'movie', 'likely', 'upset', 'watch', 'moment', 'russ', 'traumatized', 'years', 'old', 'better', 'movie', 'kiki', 'delivery', 'service', 'essentially', 'message', 'handles', 'litely', 'instead', 'drilling', 'head', 'adults', 'like', 'br', 'way', 'moment', 'movie', 'amature', 'ers', 'mind', 'think', 'bruce', 'willis', 'movie', 'sad', 'little', 'kid']","['emphasize', 'movie', 'kid', 'br', 'matter', 'well', 'spare', 'adult', 'br', 'right', 'overexaggerate', 'little', 'bad', 'kid', 'movie', 'let', 'rephrase', 'bad', 'movie', 'dissilusioned', 'adult', 'dissilusioned', 'adult', 'market', 'kid', 'jack', 'mean', 'review', 'gut', 'like', 'will', 'learn', 'surprising', 'fast', 'forward', 'end', 'credit', 'educational', 'bit', 'interesting', 'cosmic', 'phenominon', 'usually', 'end', 'adult', 'want', 'kid', 'reality', 'tend', 'way', 'duh', 'tell', 'year', 'college', 'art', 'school', 'idea', 'heck', 'kid', 'possibly', 'movie', 'likely', 'upset', 'watch', 'moment', 'russ', 'traumatize', 'year', 'old', 'well', 'movie', 'kiki', 'delivery', 'service', 'essentially', 'message', 'handle', 'litely', 'instead', 'drill', 'head', 'adult', 'like', 'br', 'way', 'moment', 'movie', 'amature', 'er', 'mind', 'think', 'bruce', 'willis', 'movie', 'sad', 'little', 'kid']"

"In 1993, with the success of the first season of Batman: The Animated Series, Warner Brothers commissioned the team responsible for the hit-show with producing a feature-length movie, originally slated for Direct-To-Video, but bumped up to theatrical status. It would become known as Batman: Mask of the Phantasm. Ten years after Phantasm, we have had an additional three feature-films released from the boys at the WB, Sub-Zero, Return of the Joker, and now, Mystery of the Batwoman joins the family.<br /><br />The plot is basic and in many ways similar to Mask of the Phantasm: A new female vigilante modeling herself after Batman has begun targeting operations run by Gotham mob boss Rupert Thorne and Oswald Cobblepot AKA The Penguin. Now, Batman must attempt to unravel the mystery of the Batwoman before she crosses the line.<br /><br />The animation is the sleeker, futuristic style that was utilized for Batman: The Animated Series' fifth and sixth seasons (AKA The New Batman Adventures). , it's quite nicely done, and just as sleek as Return of the Joker's animation. There is also some use of CGI, but it's minor compared to the overabundance of it in Sub-Zero. The music was alright. Different and exotic and similar to the Justice League score, although the points in the score when the old animated Batman theme comes up will be sure to send waves of nostalgia through the older fans' rodent-shaped hearts.<br /><br />Kevin Conroy, as always, does a wonderful job as Bruce Wayne and Batman. It's also great to have the old Batman: The Animated Series alumni back; that includes Bob Hastings (Commissioner Gordon), Robert Costanzo (Detective Bullock), Tara Strong (Barbara Gordon/Batgirl; her cameo hints at the romantic-relationship between her and Bruce that was mentioned in Batman Beyond), and Efrem Zimbalist Jr.(Alfred).<br /><br />Villains were also great - especially given that Rupert Thorne, the old mob boss from the original series, appears for the first time since the fourth season.<br /><br />Overall, while not quite reaching the standard set by Mask of the Phantasm ten years ago, MOTB carries on the torch quite nicely for the animated Batman films. And if you have the DVD and are a hardcore fan, you will love the five-minute short Chase Me.",in 1993 with the success of the first season of batman: the animated series warner brothers commissioned the team responsible for the hit-show with producing a feature-length movie originally slated for direct-to-video but bumped up to theatrical status it would become known as batman: mask of the phantasm ten years after phantasm we have had an additional three feature-films released from the boys at the wb sub-zero return of the joker and now mystery of the batwoman joins the family<br /><br />the plot is basic and in many ways similar to mask of the phantasm: a new female vigilante modeling herself after batman has begun targeting operations run by gotham mob boss rupert thorne and oswald cobblepot aka the penguin now batman must attempt to unravel the mystery of the batwoman before she crosses the line<br /><br />the animation is the sleeker futuristic style that was utilized for batman: the animated series' fifth and sixth seasons (aka the new batman adventures)  it's quite nicely done and just as sleek as return of the joker's animation there is also some use of cgi but it's minor compared to the overabundance of it in sub-zero the music was alright different and exotic and similar to the justice league score although the points in the score when the old animated batman theme comes up will be sure to send waves of nostalgia through the older fans' rodent-shaped hearts<br /><br />kevin conroy as always does a wonderful job as bruce wayne and batman it's also great to have the old batman: the animated series alumni back;

"I think this movie was supposed to be shocking. But the only way in which it is indeed shocking is how shocking badly it's been made ...and simply is. It's one-and-a-half hour of torment. Even more so for the viewer than for the characters in the movie (the five girls).<br /><br />Sure the main characters get their bloody piece in a bad way, which is basically fine, since it's a horror-movie. And I (usually) like horror-movies. I've no problem with violence in these type of movies per se. However all the violence in this film serves no end whatsoever. It's no spectacle other than that it's simply grotesque. It's so lame it even gets boring, and really quick too.<br /><br />The worst thing (if the above wasn't bad enough for ya) about this movie is that they've tried to copy the Blair Whitch Project, by filming with cheap hand-held-cameras. But (again, this too) serves no end whatsoever. In the ""Blair Which"", sure enough, there's an explanation, namely they are their with a camera looking for the blair witch. In this film, there's no other explanation than: ""Hey ya'll we wanted this to LOOK LIKE the Blair Whitch!!"" The sound in the movie is also something to get depressed about. The girls are screaming so hysterically that many a time you can't make out what they're saying. Also, no effort has been made to make anything any better, sound-wise or other wise.<br /><br />Than finally, there's the soundtrack, which is just as bad as the rest, and varies from cheap euro-house to the worst grungy hard-rock...<br /><br />My advise: Don't watch this under ANY circumstances.","i think this movie was supposed to be shocking but the only way in which it is indeed shocking is how shocking badly it's been made and simply is it's one-and-a-half hour of torment even more so for the viewer than for the characters in the movie (the five girls)<br /><br />sure the main characters get their bloody piece in a bad way which is basically fine since it's a horror-movie and i (usually) like horror-movies i've no problem with violence in these type of movies per se however all the violence in this film serves no end whatsoever it's no spectacle other than that it's simply grotesque it's so lame it even gets boring and really quick too<br /><br />the worst thing (if the above wasn't bad enough for ya) about this movie is that they've tried to copy the blair whitch project by filming with cheap hand-held-cameras but (again this too) serves no end whatsoever in the ""blair which"" sure enough there's an explanation namely they are their with a camera looking for the blair witch in this film there's no other explanation than: ""hey ya'll we wanted this to look like the blair whitch"" the sound in the movie is also something to get depressed about the girls are screaming so hysterically that many a time you can't make out what they're saying also no effort has been made to make anything any better sound-wise or other wise<br /><br />than finally there's the soundtrack which is just as bad as the rest and varies from cheap euro-house to the worst grungy hard-rock<br /><br />my advise: don't watch this under any circumstances","['think', 'movie', 'supposed', 'shocking', 'way', 'shocking', 'shocking', 'badly', 'simply', 'half', 'hour', 'torment', 'viewer', 'characters', 'movie', 'main', 'characters', 'bloody', 'piece', 'bad', 'way', 'basically', 'fine', 'horror', 'movie', 'usually', 'like', 'horror', 'movies', 'problem', 'violence', 'type', 'movies', 'se', 'violence', 'film', 'serves', 'end', 'whatsoever', 'spectacle', 'simply', 'grotesque', 'lame', 'gets', 'boring', 'quick', 'br', 'worst', 'thing', 'bad', 'ya', 'movie', 'tried', 'copy', 'blair', 'whitch', 'project', 'filming', 'cheap', 'hand', 'held', 'cameras', 'serves', 'end', 'whatsoever', 'blair', 'sure', 'explanation', 'camera', 'looking', 'blair', 'witch', 'film', 'explanation', 'hey', 'wanted', 'look', 'like', 'blair', 'whitch', 'sound', 'movie', 'depressed', 'girls', 'screaming', 'hysterically', 'time', 'saying', 'effort', 'better', 'sound', 'wise', 'wise', 'br', 'finally', 'soundtrack', 'bad', 'rest', 'varies', 'cheap', 'euro', 'house', 'worst', 'grungy', 'hard', 'rock', 'br', 'advise', 'watch', 'circumstances']","['think', 'movie', 'suppose', 'shocking', 'way', 'shocking', 'shocking', 'badly', 'simply', 'half', 'hour', 'torment', 'viewer', 'character', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'bloody', 'piece', 'bad', 'way', 'basically', 'fine', 'horror', 'movie', 'usually', 'like', 'horror', 'movie', 'problem', 'violence', 'type', 'movie', 'se', 'violence', 'film', 'serve', 'end', 'whatsoever', 'spectacle', 'simply', 'grotesque', 'lame', 'get', 'boring', 'quick', 'br', 'bad', 'thing', 'bad', 'ya', 'movie', 'try', 'copy', 'blair', 'whitch', 'project', 'film', 'cheap', 'hand', 'hold', 'camera', 'serve', 'end', 'whatsoever', 'blair', 'sure', 'explanation', 'camera', 'look', 'blair', 'witch', 'film', 'explanation', 'hey', 'want', 'look', 'like', 'blair', 'whitch', 'sound', 'movie', 'depressed', 'girl', 'scream', 'hysterically', 'time', 'say', 'effort', 'well', 'sound', 'wise', 'wise', 'br', 'finally', 'soundtrack', 'bad', 'rest', 'vary', 'cheap', 'euro', 'house', 'bad', 'grungy', 'hard', 'rock', 'br', 'advise', 'watch', 'circumstance']"
"Why can't a movie be rated a zero? Or even a negative number? Some movies such as ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"" are so bad they're fun to watch. THIS IS NOT ONE. ""The Dungeon of Horror"" might be the worst movie I've ever seen (some of anyway. I HAD to fast forward through a lot of it!). Fortunately for the indiscretions of my youth and senility of my advancing age, there may be worse movies I've seen, but thankfully, I can't remember them. The sets appeared to be made with cardboard and finished with cans of spray paint. The special effects looked like a fifth grader's C+ diorama set in a shoebox. The movie contained unforgivable gaffs such as when the Marquis shoots and kills his servant. He then immediately gets into a scuffle with his escaping victim, who takes his flintlock and shoots him with it, without the gun having been reloaded! This movie was so bad my DVD copy only had name credits. I guess no company or studio wanted to be incriminated. Though I guess when you film in your garage and make sets out of cardboard boxes a studio isn't needed. This movie definitely ranks in my cellar of all time worst movies with such horrible sacrileges as ""The Manipulator"", the worst movie I have ever seen with an actual (one time) Hollywood leading man-Mickey Rooney. The only time I would recommend watching ""The Dungeon of Harrow"" (or ""The Manipulator"" for that matter) would be if someone were to pay you.

"This movie took me by surprise. The opening credit sequence features nicely done animation. After that, we're plunged into a semi-cheesy production, betraying its low budget. The characters, typical American teens, are introduced slowly, with more personal detail than is usually found in movies like this. By the time the shlitz hits the fan, we know each one of the characters, and either like or hate them according to their distinct personalities. It's a slow uphill set-up, kind of like the ride up a slope of a really tall roller coaster. Thankfully, once the action kicks in, it's full blown old school HORROR! Steve Johnson's make-up effects are awesome. Equal in quality to much bigger budgeted films. And the scares are jolting. Kevin Tenney delivers his best movie ever, with heart-stopping surprises and creepy suspenseful set-ups. The tongue-in-cheek, sometimes cheesy, humor marks this film as pure 80s horror, as opposed to the sullen tone of earlier genre fare like ""Night of the Living Dead"" or ""Hills Have Eyes."" But for true horror fans, this one is worth checking out. Play it as the first entry on a double bill with the 1999 remake of ""House on the Haunted Hill.""

"Though I'd heard that ""Cama de Gato"" was the worst Brazilian movie of the decade, I watched it giving it a chance; after all, first-time director/producer/writer Alexandre Stockler managed to make his debut feature (shot in video) for just US$ 4,000 and -- though it looks even cheaper -- I can't begin to imagine all he went through to finally get it exhibited in theaters with no big sponsors or production companies behind it (then as I watched it I realized why). But whatever chances you're ready to give to ""Cama de Gato"", they shrink to zero within 10 minutes: it's an unbelievably preposterous, verbose, ideologically fanatical and technically catastrophic attempt to portray Brazilian upper-middle class youth as a bunch of spoiled neo-Nazis hooked on bad sex, drugs and violence (and they're made to look like closeted gays too), made with no visible trace of talent, imagination, expertise or notion of structure. Visually and aurally, it recalls the worst amateur stuff you can find on YouTube -- only here it lasts NINETY TWO (count'em) minutes of unrelenting hysteria and clumsiness, and it's not even funny-bad.<br /><br />We've all seen the story before: bored young guys want to have fun, go partying, take drugs and everything goes wrong -- there's gang-rape, spanking, murder, the accidental death (falling down the staircase!!) of the mother of one of the boys, culminating with the boys deciding to burn the corpses of the girl and the mother in a garbage landfill. Moral and literal garbage, get it? The film is heavily influenced by Larry Clark (especially ""Kids"" and ""Bully""), but Clark's films -- though also moralist and sexploitative -- are high-class masterworks compared to this crap.<br /><br />I don't think there was ever such monomaniacal drive in a filmmaker to stick his ideas down the audience's throat: Stockler grabs us by the collar and tries to force his non-stop moralist rant into our brains by repetition and exhaustion -- you DO get numb-minded with so much babbling, yelling, inept direction, shaky camera and terrible acting going on. Stockler doesn't care a bit about technique (the quality of the images, framing, sound recording, soundtrack songs, dialog, sets, editing, etc is uniformly appalling), but he's a narcissistic control-freak: he anticipates the criticisms he's bound to get by adding subtitles with smartie/cutie comments, and by making the protagonists comment at one point how far-fetched and phony it all is (I could relate to THAT). <br /><br />Despite his megalomaniac ambitions, Stockler seems incapable of giving us a minimum of visual or narrative structure -- he can't even decide if he wants gritty realism (hand-held video camera etc) or stylization (repetition of scenes, use of alternate takes, etc). Damn, he can't even decide WHERE to put his camera (there's use of subjective camera for the THREE leads)! The dialog features some of the most stupefyingly banal verbosity ever; the plot exists simply to justify the director's profound hatred for his characters and what they stand for. All you see is a filmmaker being hateful, preachy, condemning, moralizing without the benefit of a minimum of talent (or technique) to go with it.<br /><br />It's very disappointing to find Caio Blat in this mess. Certainly one of the most promising young film actors in Brazil, with his sleepy-eyed puppy dog looks and emotional edge that often recall Sal Mineo's, Blat can be highly effective under good direction (as in ""Carandiru"", ""Lavoura Arcaica"", ""Proibido Proibir""). Here, he's told to go over the top and he has to play with some of the most embarrassingly under-equipped ""actors"" in recent memory. He also enters the risky realm of graphic sexploitation scenes (so goddawful they look rather like web-cam porn).<br /><br />The film opens and ends with real interviews with ""typical"" (?) middle-class youth -- Stockler wants us to take those interviews as ""proof"" of what he's trying to preach in fiction. But he blatantly despises and makes fun of his interviewees, selecting a highlight of abject, racist, sexist, stupid statements (which only shows assholes exist everywhere). Stockler wants to prove that Brazilian middle-class youths are ALL present or future fascists BECAUSE they're middle-class and enjoy recreational drugs (is he saying all neo-fascists are on drugs?? Or that drugs potentialize fascist behavior?? I couldn't tell). <br /><br />With its dogmatic self-righteousness, headache-inducing technique and mind-bending boredom, ""Cama de Gato"" is bad for a 1,000 reasons but, above all, it's harmful in a very insidious manner: it gives detractors of Brazilian cinema a powerful case of argument. ""Cama de Gato"" is best unwatched, unmentioned, buried and forgotten.","though i'd heard that ""cama de gato"" was the worst brazilian movie of the decade i watched it giving it a chance; after all first-time director/producer/writer alexandre stockler managed to make his debut feature (shot in video) for just us$ 4000 and -- though it looks even cheaper -- i can't begin to imagine all he went through to finally get it exhibited in theaters with no big sponsors or production companies behind it (then as i watched it i realized why) but whatever chances you're ready to give to ""cama de gato"" they shrink to zero within 10 minutes: it's an unbelievably preposterous verbose ideologically fanatical and technically catastrophic attempt to portray brazilian upper-middle class youth as a bunch of spoiled neo-nazis hooked on bad sex drugs and violence (and they're made to look like closeted gays too) made with no visible trace of talent imagination expertise or notion of structure visually and aurally it recalls the worst amateur stuff you can find on youtube -- only here it lasts ninety two (count'em) minutes of unrelenting hysteria and clumsiness and it's not even funny-bad<br /><br />we've all seen the story before: bored young guys want to have fun go partying take drugs and everything goes wrong -- there's gang-rape spanking murder the accidental death (falling down the staircase) of the mother of one of the boys culminating with the boys deciding to burn the corpses of the girl and the mother in a garbage landfill moral and literal garbage get it

"An unforgettable masterpiece from the creator of The Secret of Nimh and The Land Before Time, this was a very touching bittersweet cartoon. I remember this very well from my childhood, it was funny and sad and very beautiful. Well it starts out a bit dark, a dog who escaped the pound, and gets killed by an old friend, ends up in Heaven, and comes back. But it becomes sweet when he befriends an orphaned girl who can talk to animals. Some scenes were a bit scary contrary to other cartoons, like the dream sequence of Charlie, but everything else was okay,and the songs were fair. A memorable role of Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise, I just love that guy, ahehehe. And Judith Barsi of Jaws The Revenge, may God rest her soul, poor girl, she didn't deserve to die, but she is in Heaven now, all good people go to Heaven. Overall this is a very good animated movie, a Don Bluth classic enough to put anime and Disney to shame. Recommended for the whole family. And know this, if you have the original video of this, you'll find after the movie, Dom DeLuise has a very important and special message, gotta love that guy, ahehehe.",an unforgettable masterpiece from the creator of the secret of nimh and the land before time this was a very touching bittersweet cartoon i remember this very well from my childhood it was funny and sad and very beautiful well it starts out a bit dark a dog who escaped the pound and gets killed by an old friend ends up in heaven and comes back but it becomes sweet when he befriends an orphaned girl who can talk to animals some scenes were a bit scary contrary to other cartoons like the dream sequence of charlie but everything else was okayand the songs were fair a memorable role of burt reynolds and dom deluise i just love that guy ahehehe and judith barsi of jaws the revenge may god rest her soul poor girl she didn't deserve to die but she is in heaven now all good people go to heaven overall this is a very good animated movie a don bluth classic enough to put anime and disney to shame recommended for the whole family and know this if you have the original video of this you'll find after the movie dom deluise has a very important and special message gotta love that guy ahehehe,"['unforgettable', 'masterpiece', 'creator', 'secret', 'nimh', 'land', 'time', 'touching', 'bittersweet', 'cartoon', 'remember', 'childhood', 'funny', 'sad', 'beautiful', 'starts', 'bit', 'dark', 'dog', 'escaped', 'pound', 'gets', 'killed', 'old', 'friend', 'ends', 'heaven', 'comes', 'sweet', 'befriends', 'orphaned', 'girl', 'talk', 'animals', 'scenes', 'bit', 'scary', 'contrary', 'cartoons', 'like', 'dream', 'sequence', 'charlie', 'okayand', 'songs', 'fair', 'memorable', 'role', 'burt', 'reynolds', 'dom', 'deluise', 'love', 'guy', 'ahehehe', 'judith', 'barsi', 'jaws', 'revenge', 'god', 'rest', 'soul', 'poor', 'girl', 'deserve', 'die', 'heaven', 'good', 'people', 'heaven', 'overall', 'good', 'animated', 'movie', 'don', 'bluth', 'classic', 'anime', 'disney', 'shame', 'recommended', 'family', 'know', 'original', 'video', 'find', 'movie', 'dom', 'deluise', 'important', 'special', 'message', 'got', 'ta', 'love', 'guy', 'ahehehe']","['unforgettable', 'masterpiece', 'creator', 'secret', 'nimh', 'land', 'time', 'touching', 'bittersweet', 'cartoon', 'remember', 'childhood', 'funny', 'sad', 'beautiful', 'start', 'bit', 'dark', 'dog', 'escape', 'pound', 'get', 'kill', 'old', 'friend', 'end', 'heaven', 'come', 'sweet', 'befriend', 'orphan', 'girl', 'talk', 'animal', 'scene', 'bit', 'scary', 'contrary', 'cartoon', 'like', 'dream', 'sequence', 'charlie', 'okayand', 'song', 'fair', 'memorable', 'role', 'burt', 'reynold', 'dom', 'deluise', 'love', 'guy', 'ahehehe', 'judith', 'barsi', 'jaw', 'revenge', 'god', 'rest', 'soul', 'poor', 'girl', 'deserve', 'die', 'heaven', 'good', 'people', 'heaven', 'overall', 'good', 'animate', 'movie', 'don', 'bluth', 'classic', 'anime', 'disney', 'shame', 'recommend', 'family', 'know', 'original', 'video', 'find', 'movie', 'dom', 'deluise', 'important', 'special', 'message', 'get', 'to', 'love', 'guy', 'ahehehe']"
"This movie was a failure as a comedy and a film in general. It was a very slow paced movie that seemed to be trying to convey a message, but the message was a cliché, hopeless mess to begin with. This movie falls on shameless environmental point, even making a self-righteous point of destroying an SUV and promoting Animal Planet.<br /><br />In sitting through this, I couldn't help but notice that Steve Carell got no more than a single truly funny line. The only thing that could hypothetically mark this as a comedy is the pitiful attempt to give comic relief lines to Wanda Sykes. Her character gets frequent, cringe-worthy lines where they absolutely do not fit.<br /><br />Far from the brilliance of Bruce Almighty, Evan Almighty blows its whole record-breaking budget on special effect plot devices that turn out to barely advance the plot. The movie spends the first half building up to the construction of Evan's ark, but by the end, we learn that the ark was completely meaningless, and the whole plot was a just a vessel for the stupid gags and even stupider messages. The movie concludes when we learn that the whole ark, flood, and animal gathering was just a weak political statement by none other than God. Yes, God was trying to influence politics.",this movie was a failure as a comedy and a film in general it was a very slow paced movie that seemed to be trying to convey a message but the message was a clich hopeless mess to begin with this movie falls on shameless environmental point even making a self-righteous point of destroying an suv and promoting animal planet<br /><br />in sitting through this i couldn't help but notice that steve carell got no more than a single truly funny line the only thing that could hypothetically mark this as a comedy is the pitiful attempt to give comic relief lines to wanda sykes her character gets frequent cringe-worthy lines where they absolutely do not fit<br /><br />far from the brilliance of bruce almighty evan almighty blows its whole record-breaking budget on special effect plot devices that turn out to barely advance the plot the movie spends the first half building up to the construction of evan's ark but by the end we learn that the ark was completely meaningless and the whole plot was a just a vessel for the stupid gags and even stupider messages the movie concludes when we learn that the whole ark flood and animal gathering was just a weak political statement by none other than god yes god was trying to influence politics,"['movie', 'failure', 'comedy', 'film', 'general', 'slow', 'paced', 'movie', 'trying', 'convey', 'message', 'message', 'clich', 'hopeless', 'mess', 'begin', 'movie', 'falls', 'shameless', 'environmental', 'point', 'making', 'self', 'righteous', 'point', 'destroying', 'suv', 'promoting', 'animal', 'planet', 'br', 'sitting', 'help', 'notice', 'steve', 'carell', 'got', 'single', 'truly', 'funny', 'line', 'thing', 'hypothetically', 'mark', 'comedy', 'pitiful', 'attempt', 'comic', 'relief', 'lines', 'wanda', 'sykes', 'character', 'gets', 'frequent', 'cringe', 'worthy', 'lines', 'absolutely', 'fit', 'br', 'brilliance', 'bruce', 'almighty', 'evan', 'almighty', 'blows', 'record', 'breaking', 'budget', 'special', 'effect', 'plot', 'devices', 'turn', 'barely', 'advance', 'plot', 'movie', 'spends', 'half', 'building', 'construction', 'evan', 'ark', 'end', 'learn', 'ark', 'completely', 'meaningless', 'plot', 'vessel', 'stupid', 'gags', 'stupider', 'messages', 'movie', 'concludes', 'learn', 'ark', 'flood', 'animal', 'gathering', 'weak', 'political', 'statement', 'god', 'yes', 'god', 'trying', 'influence', 'politics']","['movie', 'failure', 'comedy', 'film', 'general', 'slow', 'pace', 'movie', 'try', 'convey', 'message', 'message', 'clich', 'hopeless', 'mess', 'begin', 'movie', 'fall', 'shameless', 'environmental', 'point', 'make', 'self', 'righteous', 'point', 'destroy', 'suv', 'promote', 'animal', 'planet', 'br', 'sit', 'help', 'notice', 'steve', 'carell', 'get', 'single', 'truly', 'funny', 'line', 'thing', 'hypothetically', 'mark', 'comedy', 'pitiful', 'attempt', 'comic', 'relief', 'line', 'wanda', 'syke', 'character', 'get', 'frequent', 'cringe', 'worthy', 'line', 'absolutely', 'fit', 'br', 'brilliance', 'bruce', 'almighty', 'evan', 'almighty', 'blow', 'record', 'break', 'budget', 'special', 'effect', 'plot', 'device', 'turn', 'barely', 'advance', 'plot', 'movie', 'spend', 'half', 'build', 'construction', 'evan', 'ark', 'end', 'learn', 'ark', 'completely', 'meaningless', 'plot', 'vessel', 'stupid', 'gag', 'stupider', 'message', 'movie', 'conclude', 'learn', 'ark', 'flood', 'animal', 'gathering', 'weak', 'political', 'statement', 'god', 'yes', 'god', 'try', 'influence', 'politic']"
"It is so gratifying to see one great piece of art converted into another without distortion or contrivance. I had no guess as to how such an extraordinary piece of literature could be recreated as a film worth seeing. If you loved Bulgakov's book you would be, understandably, afraid of seeing some misguided interpretation done more for the sake of an art-film project than for actually bringing the story's deeper meaning to the screen. There are a couple examples of this with the Master and Margarita. As complex and far-fetched as the story is, the movie leaves out nothing. It is as if the filmmaker read Bulgakov's work the same way an orchestral conductor reads a score--with not a note missed. Why can't we find such talent here in the U.S. ? So now my favorite book and movie have the same title.",it is so gratifying to see one great piece of art converted into another without distortion or contrivance i had no guess as to how such an extraordinary piece of literature could be recreated as a film worth seeing if you loved bulgakov's book you would be understandably afraid of seeing some misguided interpretation done more for the sake of an art-film project than for actually bringing the story's deeper meaning to the screen there are a couple examples of this with the master and margarita as complex and far-fetched as the story is the movie leaves out nothing it is as if the filmmaker read bulgakov's work the same way an orchestral conductor reads a score--with not a note missed why can't we find such talent here in the us  so now my favorite book and movie have the same title,"['gratifying', 'great', 'piece', 'art', 'converted', 'distortion', 'contrivance', 'guess', 'extraordinary', 'piece', 'literature', 'recreated', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing', 'loved', 'bulgakov', 'book', 'understandably', 'afraid', 'seeing', 'misguided', 'interpretation', 'sake', 'art', 'film', 'project', 'actually', 'bringing', 'story', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'screen', 'couple', 'examples', 'master', 'margarita', 'complex', 'far', 'fetched', 'story', 'movie', 'leaves', 'filmmaker', 'read', 'bulgakov', 'work', 'way', 'orchestral', 'conductor', 'reads', 'score', 'note', 'missed', 'find', 'talent', 'favorite', 'book', 'movie', 'title']","['gratifying', 'great', 'piece', 'art', 'convert', 'distortion', 'contrivance', 'guess', 'extraordinary', 'piece', 'literature', 'recreate', 'film', 'worth', 'see', 'love', 'bulgakov', 'book', 'understandably', 'afraid', 'see', 'misguided', 'interpretation', 'sake', 'art', 'film', 'project', 'actually', 'bring', 'story', 'deep', 'meaning', 'screen', 'couple', 'example', 'master', 'margarita', 'complex', 'far', 'fetched', 'story', 'movie', 'leave', 'filmmaker', 'read', 'bulgakov', 'work', 'way', 'orchestral', 'conductor', 'read', 'score', 'note', 'miss', 'find', 'talent', 'favorite', 'book', 'movie', 'title']"
"This movie is very violent, yet exciting with original dialog and cool characters. It has one of the most moving stories and is very true to life. The movie start off with action star Leo Fong as a down and out cop who is approaching the end of his career, when he stumbles on to a big case that involves corruption, black mail and murder.

"The day has finally come for me to witness the perpetuation of Azumi's fate as an assassin, fruition of her character and the ultimate attempt to draw me deeper into the world she rampaged through so mercilessly during the first saga.<br /><br />That's as poetical as I'll get when talking about Azumi 2: Death or Love, because when I cringed over the heavy sentimentality of House of Flying Daggers and complained about the credibility of Aya Ueto portraying a blood-driven assassin, after watching Azumi 2 I started to appreciate the previously mentioned shortcomings more than ever before.<br /><br />Not only does the determination of each assassin feels sluggish and uninspiring but also many important elements are omitted from the entire experience. In Azumi 1 we saw the assassins use various stealth tactics (which is their number one priority) as well as logic to make easy work of their marks with swift executions and quicker abilities to escape. But I won't hold that against this movie too much since the story is slightly tweaked this time around and many more obstacles are planted in Azumi's way to prevent her from reaching the warlord and displaying any signs of charisma. By the way, Chiaki is foolishly shelved for the most part of the film and is basically playing a toned down version of Go Go, minus the cool weapon and sense of menace.<br /><br />This brings me to the final blow which is the action, simply disguised in the title as the 'Death' side of the epic. In the first half of the film we see the debut of many promising adversaries with flashy looks and even flashier weapons. To no one's surprise they meet their end one way or another but the film falls short when each of them start dying too fast and too easily. In Azumi 1, the young assassins were mostly overpowering the opposition with quick but somewhat satisfying battles and the final showdown between Azumi and Bijomaru in comparison to the fights in Azumi 2 was at least climaxed and worthwhile. Some interesting effects were introduced but they were unable to achieve innovation due to the shortness of each encounter. I am in no way knocking down the conventional style of samurai films with their quick and realistic battles but characters in both Azumi films were so imaginative and straight out of anime that the rules could have been broken and the action should have been further enriched.<br /><br />The romance side of Azumi is there to fill in time between the fight scenes and unfortunately at the end it serves no purpose nor provides a much needed resolution.<br /><br />As a fan with an open mind for wide variety of movies and animation, I won't lie and I'll admit to my neutrality and unimpressiveness towards the first Azumi film, but I'll step right up and say that after watching Azumi 2, the original was made to look like a flawless masterpiece.

"This has to be the worst piece of garbage I've seen in a while.<br /><br />Heath Ledger is a heartthrob? He looked deformed. I wish I'd known that he and Naomi Watts are an item in real life because I spent 2 of the longest hours of my life wondering what she saw in him. <br /><br />Orlando Bloom is a heartthrob? With the scraggly beard and deer-in-the-headlights look about him, I can't say I agree.<br /><br />Rachel Griffiths was her usual fabulous self, but Geoffrey Rush looked as if he couldn't wait to get off the set. <br /><br />I'm supposed to feel sorry for bankrobbers and murderers? This is a far cry from Butch Cassidy, which actually WAS an entertaining film. This was trite, cliche-ridden and boring. We only stayed because we were convinced it would get better. It didn't.<br /><br />The last 10-15 minutes or so were unintentionally hilarious. Heath and his gang are holed up in a frontier hotel, and women and children are dying because of their presence. That's not funny. But it was funny when they walked out of the hotel with the armor on, because all we could think of was the Black Knight from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I kept waiting for them to say ""I'll bite yer leg off!"" We were howling with laughter, as were several other warped members of the audience. When we left, pretty much everyone was talking about what a waste of time this film was.<br /><br />I may not have paid cash to see this disaster (sneak preview), but it certainly wasn't free. It cost me 2 hours of my life that I will never get back.","this has to be the worst piece of garbage i've seen in a while<br /><br />heath ledger is a heartthrob he looked deformed i wish i'd known that he and naomi watts are an item in real life because i spent 2 of the longest hours of my life wondering what she saw in him <br /><br />orlando bloom is a heartthrob with the scraggly beard and deer-in-the-headlights look about him i can't say i agree<br /><br />rachel griffiths was her usual fabulous self but geoffrey rush looked as if he couldn't wait to get off the set <br /><br />i'm supposed to feel sorry for bankrobbers and murderers this is a far cry from butch cassidy which actually was an entertaining film this was trite cliche-ridden and boring we only stayed because we were convinced it would get better it didn't<br /><br />the last 10-15 minutes or so were unintentionally hilarious heath and his gang are holed up in a frontier hotel and women and children are dying because of their presence that's not funny but it was funny when they walked out of the hotel with the armor on because all we could think of was the black knight from monty python and the holy grail i kept waiting for them to say ""i'll bite yer leg off"" we were howling with laughter as were several other warped members of the audience when we left pretty much everyone was talking about what a waste of time this film was<br /><br />i may not have paid cash to see this disaster (sneak preview) but it certainly wasn't free it cost me 2 hours of my life that i will never get back","['worst', 'piece', 'garbage', 'seen', 'br', 'ledger', 'heartthrob', 'looked', 'deformed', 'wish', 'known', 'naomi', 'watts', 'item', 'real', 'life', 'spent', 'longest', 'hours', 'life', 'wondering', 'saw', 'br', 'bloom', 'heartthrob', 'scraggly', 'beard', 'deer', 'headlights', 'look', 'agree', 'br', 'griffiths', 'usual', 'fabulous', 'self', 'geoffrey', 'rush', 'looked', 'wait', 'set', 'br', 'supposed', 'feel', 'sorry', 'bankrobbers', 'murderers', 'far', 'cry', 'butch', 'cassidy', 'actually', 'entertaining', 'film', 'trite', 'cliche', 'ridden', 'boring', 'stayed', 'convinced', 'better', 'br', 'minutes', 'unintentionally', 'hilarious', 'heath', 'gang', 'holed', 'frontier', 'hotel', 'women', 'children', 'dying', 'presence', 'funny', 'funny', 'walked', 'hotel', 'armor', 'think', 'black', 'knight', 'monty', 'python', 'holy', 'grail', 'kept', 'waiting', 'bite', 'yer', 'leg', 'howling', 'laughter', 'warped', 'members', 'audience', 'left', 'pretty', 'talking', 'waste', 'time', 'film', 'br', 'paid', 'cash', 'disaster', 'sneak', 'preview', 'certainly', 'free', 'cost', 'hours', 'life']","['bad', 'piece', 'garbage', 'see', 'br', 'ledger', 'heartthrob', 'look', 'deform', 'wish', 'know', 'naomi', 'watt', 'item', 'real', 'life', 'spend', 'long', 'hour', 'life', 'wonder', 'see', 'br', 'bloom', 'heartthrob', 'scraggly', 'beard', 'deer', 'headlight', 'look', 'agree', 'br', 'griffith', 'usual', 'fabulous', 'self', 'geoffrey', 'rush', 'look', 'wait', 'set', 'br', 'suppose', 'feel', 'sorry', 'bankrobber', 'murderer', 'far', 'cry', 'butch', 'cassidy', 'actually', 'entertaining', 'film', 'trite', 'cliche', 'ridden', 'boring', 'stay', 'convince', 'well', 'br', 'minute', 'unintentionally', 'hilarious', 'heath', 'gang', 'hole', 'frontier', 'hotel', 'woman', 'child', 'die', 'presence', 'funny', 'funny', 'walk', 'hotel', 'armor', 'think', 'black', 'knight', 'monty', 'python', 'holy', 'grail', 'keep', 'wait', 'bite', 'yer', 'leg', 'howl', 'laughter', 'warped', 'member', 'audience', 'leave', 'pretty', 'talk', 'waste', 'time', 'film', 'br', 'pay', 'cash', 'disaster', 'sneak', 'preview', 'certainly', 'free', 'cost', 'hour', 'life']"

"I'm sure deep in the recesses of Jack Blacks mind the character of Nacho Libre is absolutely hilarious but no it isn't. You can tell ol Jacks having a whale of a time hammin it up playing a smarmy, slimy Mexican friar with dreams of becoming a wrestler but this movie is a total misfire in just about every single department.<br /><br />I just sat there through most of the movie thinking ""Is this supposed to be funny"" and ""This is the guy from Tenacious D right?"". The truth is this film has NOTHING to offer. AT ALL! It's a lousy script with crappy characters and really naff acting and direction. You'll watch endless moments where you think something funny is surely about to happen but it just doesn't. I was bored stupid about 10 minutes in but though it would surely pick up. It didn't. 90 minutes later I'd barely managed to stave off an aneurism it was that painful.<br /><br />It's like, remember years ago when you'd see anything with your fave actor in it, even some of their really early pap from before they were famous, and you'd be really embarrassed that said actor was actually in such a load of plop. Yeah it's like that.<br /><br />I've enjoyed some of Jack Black's earlier movies like Shallow Hall and I'm really looking forward to seeing Pick of Destiny but come on man. If you do this to us again Jack I'm gonna have to come round there and hammer your kneecaps or something.

"I haven't read the Anne Rice novel that this movie was based on, but who knows, maybe reading the book is cheaper than renting QUEEN OF THE DAMNED and is probably better for your health. It isn't that this movie is necessarily bad for your health, but a book can be very relaxing and certainly exercises the active part of your brain more so than this movie. You can count the number of pages by Anne Rice that I've read on one hand, but after seeing this movie and Interview with a Vampire, I get the feeling that she writes really good novels. The plots for both movies hint at a whole sea of deep and interwoven vampire history.<br /><br />Still, Stuart Townsend's voice-over narration gets a heck of a lot more annoying than Brad Pitt's vampire narrative ever did, and you can tell that QUEEN OF THE DAMNED's limited production resources barely give enough flesh to the Anne Rice storyline. While Interview decided to go with lace and elegance, QUEEN relies on low budget special effects that try really hard to be taken seriously. One can see that the original novel had potential as a movie and that the production team focused its attention in the wrong places. The costumes and rock & roll stage could have been replaced with more blood and an eerier soundtrack.<br /><br />However, I'll give credit where credit is due. The soundtrack is excellent. Korn and Disturbed had me down with the sickness bobbing my noggin like Butthead.<br /><br />The film opens with a very cool Goth-rock zoom & splice montage, but after the first ten minutes or so, the directing degenerates quickly. It's as if the movie was so long that the director realized that there wasn't enough time and enough money to do an Anne Rice novel justice. What results are some mediocre vampire scenes and plenty of cheesy special effects. Unfortunately, QUEEN OF THE DAMNED fails to do the genre justice just as its John Carpenter counterparts fail to impress. Where are the yellow contacts? Where's the pale blue make-up? Scene after scene, I shook my head reminiscing about the days of Salem's Lot and Fright Night when low budget was done right.<br /><br />There are redeeming qualities though that save this movie from being garbage. Props to Aaliyah, and may her soul forever rest in peace. She might have become a renowned actress, had her life not been taken from us so prematurely, for she did give this movie a decent performance with plenty of nice belly dancing. Did I mention that the soundtrack was good? Let's see, what else can I say? It wasn't too long. The Anne Rice novel could have easily been a three hour movie if an ambitious director like Francis Ford Coppola got his hands on it. There are a few twists and turns here and there in the plot. But all in all it was a legitimate rock and roll addition to the slew of second-rate vampire movies out there.

the soundtrack was good let's see what else can i say it wasn't too long the anne rice novel could have easily been a three hour movie if an ambitious director like francis ford coppola got his hands on it there are a few twists and turns here and there in the plot but all in all it was a legitimate rock and roll addition to the slew of second-rate vampire movies out there the director of this movie went on to direct a new battlestar galactica mini series if that tells you anything<br /><br />jy<br /><br />jimboduck-dot-com,"['read', 'anne', 'rice', 'novel', 'movie', 'based', 'knows',

"While I count myself as a fan of the Babylon 5 television series, the original movie that introduced the series was a weak start. Although many of the elements that would later mature and become much more compelling in the series are there, the pace of The Gathering is slow, the makeup somewhat inadequate, and the plot confusing. Worse, the characterization in the premiere episode is poor.

"Leonard Maltin gave this film a dreaded BOMB rating in his 1995 Movie and Video Guide. What film was he looking at? Kid Vengeance or God's Gun are bombs. This film is a delight. It is fantastic. It is literate. It is well mounted. It is beautiful photographed, making a brilliant use of colors. Right from the opening scene the film grabs your attention and tips you off that this film is a well-done satire of the whole Spaghetti Western genre. The film is played for laughs from the beginning to the end with homages to Douglas Fairbanks, 77 Sunset Strip, and the famous showdown in the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. Edd Byrnes, George Hilton, and Gilbert Roland work brilliantly together to make the satire work. It is too bad Mr. Maltin rated this film so poorly as it is undeserved. One can only guess as to his reason. I suspect that he missed the point of the movie entirely and was expecting something more serious than this film is meant to be. Kudos belong to everyone involved in this project. This film is a little gem waiting to be discovered by people who care about literate movies and appreciate satire.",leonard maltin gave this film a dreaded bomb rating in his 1995 movie and video guide what film was he looking at kid vengeance or god's gun are bombs this film is a delight it is fantastic it is literate it is well mounted it is beautiful photographed making a brilliant use of colors right from the opening scene the film grabs your attention and tips you off that this film is a well-done satire of the whole spaghetti western genre the film is played for laughs from the beginning to the end with homages to douglas fairbanks 77 sunset strip and the famous showdown in the good the bad and the ugly edd byrnes george hilton and gilbert roland work brilliantly together to make the satire work it is too bad mr maltin rated this film so poorly as it is undeserved one can only guess as to his reason i suspect that he missed the point of the movie entirely and was expecting something more serious than this film is meant to be kudos belong to everyone involved in this project this film is a little gem waiting to be discovered by people who care about literate movies and appreciate satire,"['leonard', 'maltin', 'gave', 'film', 'dreaded', 'bomb', 'rating', 'movie', 'video', 'guide', 'film', 'looking', 'kid', 'vengeance', 'god', 'gun', 'bombs', 'film', 'delight', 'fantastic', 'literate', 'mounted', 'beautiful', 'photographed', 'making', 'brilliant', 'use', 'colors', 'right', 'opening', 'scene', 'film', 'grabs', 'attention', 'tips', 'film', 'satire', 'spaghetti', 'western', 'genre', 'film', 'played', 'laughs', 'beginning', 'end', 'homages', 'douglas', 'fairbanks', 'sunset', 'strip', 'famous', 'showdown', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'edd', 'byrnes', 'george', 'hilton', 'gilbert', 'roland', 'work', 'brilliantly', 'satire', 'work', 'bad', 'mr', 'maltin', 'rated', 'film', 'poorly', 'undeserved', 'guess', 'reason', 'suspect', 'missed', 'point', 'movie', 'entirely', 'expecting', 'film', 'meant', 'kudos', 'belong', 'involved', 'project', 'film', 'little', 'gem', 'waiting', 'discovered', 'people', 'care', 'literate', 'movies', 'appreciate', 'satire']","['leonard', 'maltin', 'give', 'film', 'dread', 'bomb', 'rating', 'movie', 'video', 'guide', 'film', 'look', 'kid', 'vengeance', 'god', 'gun', 'bomb', 'film', 'delight', 'fantastic', 'literate', 'mount', 'beautiful', 'photographed', 'make', 'brilliant', 'use', 'color', 'right', 'opening', 'scene', 'film', 'grab', 'attention', 'tip', 'film', 'satire', 'spaghetti', 'western', 'genre', 'film', 'play', 'laugh', 'beginning', 'end', 'homage', 'douglas', 'fairbank', 'sunset', 'strip', 'famous', 'showdown', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'edd', 'byrnes', 'george', 'hilton', 'gilbert', 'roland', 'work', 'brilliantly', 'satire', 'work', 'bad', 'mr', 'maltin', 'rate', 'film', 'poorly', 'undeserved', 'guess', 'reason', 'suspect', 'miss', 'point', 'movie', 'entirely', 'expect', 'film', 'mean', 'kudo', 'belong', 'involve', 'project', 'film', 'little', 'gem', 'wait', 'discover', 'people', 'care', 'literate', 'movie', 'appreciate', 'satire']"
"I don't believe there has ever been a more evil or wicked television program to air in the United States as The 700 Club. They are today's equivalent to the Ku Klux Klan of the 20th century. Their hatred of all that is good and sweet and human and pure is beyond all ability to understand. Their daily constant attacks upon millions and millions of Americans, as well as billions of humans the world over, who don't happen to share their bigoted, cruel, monstrous, and utterly insane view of humanity is beyond anything television has ever seen. The lies they spout and the ridiculous lies they try to pass off as truth, such as the idea of ""life after death"" or ""god"" or ""sin"" or ""the devil"" is so preposterous that they actually seem mentally ill, so lost are they in their fantasy. Sane people know that religion is a drug and shouldn't let themselves get addicted to that type of fantasy. However, The 700 Club is in a class by itself. They are truly a cult. While I believe in freedom of speech, they way they spread hatred, lies, disinformation, and such fantastic ideas is beyond all limits. I hope that one day the American Psychiatric Association will finally take up the study of those people who delude themselves in this way, people who let themselves sink so deeply into the fantasy land of religion that they no longer have any real concept of reality at all. Treatment for such afflicted individuals is sorely needed in this country, as so many people have completely lost their minds to the fantasy of religion. The 700 Club though, is even more horrible as it rises to the legal definition of 'cult' but due to The 700 Club's vast wealth (conned daily from the millions of Americans locked in their deceitful grip) they are above the law in this country. For those of you who have seen the movie ""The Matrix"" you know that movie was a metaphor for religion on earth: the evil ones who are at the top of each of the religions who drain the ones they have trapped and cruelly abuse for their own selfish purposes, and those millions who are held in a death sleep and slowly being drained of their life force represent those many people who belong to religions and who have lost all ability to perceive what is really going on around them.<br /><br />In less civil times, the good townsfolk would have run such monsters as those associated with The 700 Club out of town with torches and pitchforks. But in today's world where people have lost all choice in their choices of television that is presented to them, we have no way to rid ourselves of the 700 Club plague. <br /><br />The television ratings system and the ""V"" chip on TV's should also have a rating called ""R"" for religion, so that rational people and concerned parents could easily screen such vile intellectual and brutal emotional rape, such as presented by The 700 Club every day all over our country, from themselves and their children.","i don't believe there has ever been a more evil or wicked television program to

"If you wish to see Shakespeare's masterpiece in its entirety, I suggest you find this BBC version. Indeed it is overlong at four and a half hours but Jacoby's performance as Hamlet and Patrick Stewart's as Claudius are well worth the effort.<br /><br />It never ceases to amaze me how clear ""Hamlet"" is when you see it in its length and order as set down by the Bard. Every film version of ""Hamlet"" has tinkered with its structure. Olivier concentrated on Hamlet's indecision, Gibson on his passions. Jacoby is able to pull all of these aspects of Hamlet's character together with the aid of Shakespeare's full script.<br /><br />Why does Hamlet not kill Claudius immediately? Hamlet says ""I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious..."" Hamlet is extremely upset, not only for his father's death (and suspected murder), or his mother's marriage to his uncle, but also, and mostly, because Claudius has usurped the throne belonging to Hamlet. He is furious at his mother for marrying Claudius (marriages between royal kin is not unknown; done for political reasons) but that her marriage solidified Claudius' claim to the throne before he could return from Wittenburg to claim it for himself. He is, therefore, impotent to do anything about it. And this is true even after he hears his father's ghost cry vengeance. He cannot simply kill the King or he will lose the throne in doing so. He must ""out"" the King's secret and here is the tragedy! At the moment Hamlet is successful in displaying Claudius' guilt in public, he has opportunity to kill him and does not. WHY? He wants it ALL! He wants revenge, the throne AND the damnation of Claudius' soul in hell. Hamlet OVERREACHES himself in classic tragic form. His own HUBRIS is his undoing. He kills Polonius thinking it is Claudius and the rest of the play spirals down to the final deaths of Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, Ophelia, Laertes, Gertrude, Claudius and Hamlet himself.","if you wish to see shakespeare's masterpiece in its entirety i suggest you find this bbc version indeed it is overlong at four and a half hours but jacoby's performance as hamlet and patrick stewart's as claudius are well worth the effort<br /><br />it never ceases to amaze me how clear ""hamlet"" is when you see it in its length and order as set down by the bard every film version of ""hamlet"" has tinkered with its structure olivier concentrated on hamlet's indecision gibson on his passions jacoby is able to pull all of these aspects of hamlet's character together with the aid of shakespeare's full script<br /><br />why does hamlet not kill claudius immediately hamlet says ""i am very proud revengeful ambitious"" hamlet is extremely upset not only for his father's death (and suspected murder) or his mother's marriage to his uncle but also and mostly because claudius has usurped the throne belonging to hamlet he is furious at his mother for marrying claudius (marriages between royal kin is not unknown;

Salvatore, a middle-aged man who hopes for a more fruitful life, persuades his family to leave their homeland behind in Sicily, take the arduous journey across the raging seas, and inhabit a land whose rivers supposedly flow with milk. In short, they believe that by risking everything for the New World their dreams of prosperity will be fulfilled. The imagery of the New World is optimistic, clever and highly imaginative. Silver coins rain from heaven upon Salvatore as he anticipates how prosperous he'll be in the New World; carrots and onions twice the size of human beings are shown being harvested to suggest wealth and health, and rivers of milk are swam in and flow through the minds of those who anticipate what the New World will yield. All of this imagery is surrealistically interwoven with the characters and helps nicely compliment the gritty realism that the story unfolds to the audience. The contrast between this imagery versus the dark reality of the Sicilian people helps provide hope while they're aboard the ship to the New World.<br /><br />The voyage to the New World is shot almost in complete darkness, especially when the seas tempests roar and nearly kill the people within. The dark reality I referred to is the Old World and the journey itself to the New World. The Old World is depicted as somewhat destitute and primitive. This is shown as Salvatore scrambles together to sell what few possessions he has left (donkeys, goats and rabbits) in order to obtain the appropriate clothing he needs to enter the New World. I thought it was rather interesting that these people believed they had to conform to a certain dress code in order to be accepted in the New World; it was almost suggesting that people had to fit a particular stereotype or mold in order to be recognized as morally fit. The most powerful image in the film was when the ship is leaving their homeland and setting sail for the New World. This shot shows an overhead view of a crowd of people who slowly seem to separate from one another, depicting the separation between the Old and New Worlds. This shot also suggested that the people were being torn away from all that was once familiar, wanted to divorce from their previous dark living conditions and were desirous to enter a world that held more promise.<br /><br />As later contrasted to how the New World visually looks, the Old World seems dark and bleak as compared to the bright yet foggy New World. I thought it was particularly interesting that the Statue of Liberty is never shown through the fog at Ellis Island, but is remained hidden. I think this was an intentional directing choice that seemed to negate the purpose of what the Statue of Liberty stands for: ""Give me your poor, your tired, your hungry"" seemed like a joke in regards to what these people had to go through when arriving at the New World. Once they arrived in the Americas, they had to go through rather humiliating tests (i.e. delousing, mathematics, puzzles, etc.) in order to prove themselves as fit for the New World. These tests completely changed the perspectives of the Sicilian people. In particular, Salvatore's mother had the most difficult time subjecting herself to the rules and laws of the New World, feeling more violated than treated with respect. Where their dreams once provided hope and optimism for what the New World would provide, the reality of what the New World required was disparaging and rude. Salvatore doesn't change much other than his attitude towards what he felt the New World would be like versus what the New World actually was seemed disappointing to him. This attitude was shared by mostly everyone who voyaged with him. Their character arcs deal more with a cherished dream being greatly upset and a dark reality that had to be accepted.<br /><br />The film seems to make a strong commentary on preparing oneself to enter a heavenly and civilized society. Cleanliness, marriage and intelligence are prerequisites. Adhering to these rules is to prevent disease, immoral behavior and stupidity from dominating. Perhaps this is a commentary on how America has learned from the failings of other nations and so was purposefully established to secure that these plagues did not infest and destruct. Though the rules seemed rigid, they were there to protect and help the people flourish.","the golden door is the story of a sicilian family's journey from the old world (italy) to the new world

Now 22-year-old Jedi warrior hero Annakin has a couple of bad dreams, and so takes to slaughtering children, his friends, and the entire framework of his existence because a crazy old man convinced him a) his precious wife might really die, and b) only he can prevent this. Ludicrosity squared.<br /><br />I think the people who like this movie are not paying attention. The story is ridiculous. The characters are unbelievable (literally, not the perverted sense of ""fantastic"", ""wonderful"", etc.).<br /><br />Obi-wan Kenobi was the wise and kind anchor for the entire series, but in the climax, he hacks off Annakin's legs, lets him burn in the lava, and leaves him to suffer. Doesn't anyone think that's a little out of character? Not to mention it was pretty stupid to take a chance on him living, as it turns out.<br /><br />I was expecting at least a story that showed consistent characters with plausible motivations. None of that here. The story could have been written by a 10 year old.<br /><br />Oh yeah, the CGI is pretty cool.","ludicrous angelic 9-year-old annakin turns into whiny brat 19-year-old annakin who somehow seems appealing to amidala 5 years his senior now 22-year-old jedi warrior hero annakin has a couple of bad dreams and so takes to slaughtering children his friends and the entire framework of his existence because a crazy old man convinced him a) his precious wife might really die and b) only he can prevent this ludicrosity squared<br /><br />i think the people who like this movie are not paying attention the story is ridiculous the characters are unbelievable (literally not the perverted sense of ""fantastic"" ""wonderful"" etc)<br /><br />obi-wan kenobi was the wise and kind anchor for the entire series but in the climax he hacks off annakin's legs lets him burn in the lava and leaves him to suffer doesn't anyone think that's a little out of character not to mention it was pretty stupid to take a chance on him living as it turns out<br /><br />i was expecting at least a story that showed consistent characters with plausible motivations none of that here the story could have been written by a 10 year old<br /><br />oh yeah the cgi is pretty cool","['ludicrous', 'angelic', 'year', 'old', 'annakin', 'turns', 'whiny', 'brat', 'year', 'old', 'annakin', 'appealing', 'amidala', 'years', 'senior', 'year', 'old', 'jedi', 'warrior', 'hero', 'annakin', 'couple', 'bad', 'dreams', 'takes', 'slaughtering', 'children', 'friends', 'entire', 'framework', 'existence', 'crazy', 'old', 'man', 'convinced', 'precious', 'wife', 'die', 'b', 'prevent', 'ludicrosity', 'squared', 'br', 'think', 'people', 'like', 'movie', 'paying', 'attention', 'story', 'ridiculous', 'characters', 'unbelievable', 'literally', 'perverted', 'sense', 'fantastic', 'wonderful', 'wan', 'kenobi', 'wise', 'kind', 'anchor', 'entire', 'series', 'climax', 'hacks', 'annakin', 'legs', 'lets', 'burn', 'lava', 'leaves', 'suffer', 'think', 'little', 'character', 'mention', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'chance', 'living', 'turns', 'br', 'expecting', 'story', 'showed', 'consistent', 'characters', 'plausible', 'motivations', 'story', 'written', 'year', 'old', 'br', 'yeah', 'cgi', 'pretty', 'cool']","['ludicrous', 'angelic', 'year', 'old', 'annakin', 'turn', 'whiny', 'brat', 'year', 'old', 'annakin', 'appeal', 'amidala', 'year', 'senior', 'year', 'old', 'jedi', 'warrior', 'hero', 'annakin', 'couple', 'bad', 'dream', 'take', 'slaughter', 'child', 'friend', 'entire', 'framework', 'existence', 'crazy', 'old', 'man', 'convince', 'precious', 'wife', 'die', 'b', 'prevent', 'ludicrosity', 'square', 'br', 'think', 'people', 'like', 'movie', 'pay', 'attention', 'story', 'ridiculous', 'character', 'unbelievable', 'literally', 'perverted', 'sense', 'fantastic', 'wonderful', 'wan', 'kenobi', 'wise', 'kind', 'anchor', 'entire', 'series', 'climax', 'hack', 'annakin', 'leg', 'let', 'burn', 'lava', 'leave', 'suffer', 'think', 'little', 'character', 'mention', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'chance', 'live', 'turn', 'br', 'expect', 'story', 'show', 'consistent', 'character', 'plausible', 'motivation', 'story', 'write', 'year', 'old', 'br', 'yeah', 'cgi', 'pretty', 'cool']"

"If you keep rigid historical perspective out of it, this film is actually quite entertaining. It's got action, adventure and romance, and one of the premiere casting match-ups of the era with Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland in the lead roles. As evident on this board, the picture doesn't pass muster with purists who look for one hundred percent accuracy in their story telling. To get beyond that, one need only put aside the history book, and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction. I know, I know, that's hard to do when you consider Custer's Last Stand at the Little Big Horn and it's prominence in the history of post Civil War America. So I guess there's an unresolved quandary with the picture, no matter how you look at it.<br /><br />There's a lot to take in here though for the picture's two hour plus run time. Custer's arrival at West Point is probably the first head scratcher, riding up as he does in full military regalia. The practical joke by Sharp (Arthur Kennedy) putting him up in the Major's headquarters probably should have gotten them both in trouble.<br /><br />Ironically, a lot of scenes in this military film play for comedy, as in Custer's first meeting with Libby Bacon, and subsequent encounters that include tea reader Callie (Hattie McDaniel). I hadn't noticed it before in other films, but McDaniel reminded me an awful lot of another favorite character actor of mine from the Forties, Mantan Moreland. So much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been Moreland hamming it up in a dress. With that in mind, the owl scene was a hoot too.<br /><br />As for Flynn, it's interesting to note that a year earlier, he portrayed J.E.B. Stuart opposite Ronald Reagan's depiction of General Custer in ""Santa Fe Trail"", both vying for the attention of none other than Olivia de Havilland. In that film, Reagan put none of the arrogance and flamboyance into the character of Custer that history remembers, while in Flynn's portrayal here it's more than evident. But it doesn't come close to that of Richard Mulligan's take on the military hero in 1970's ""Little Big Man"". Let's just say that one was a bit over the top.<br /><br />The better take away the picture had for me was the manner in which Custer persevered to maintain his good name and not gamble it away on a risky business venture. That and his loyalty to the men he led in battle along with the discipline he developed over the course of the story. Most poignant was that final confrontation with arch rival Sharp just before riding into the Little Big Horn, in which he declared that hell or glory was entirely dependent on one's point of view. Earlier, a similar remark might have given us the best insight of all into Custer's character, when he stated - ""You take glory with you when it's your time to go"".","if you keep rigid historical perspective out of it this film is actually quite entertaining it's got action adventure and romance and one of the premiere casting match-ups of the era with errol flynn and olivia de havilland in the lead roles as evident on this board the picture doesn't pass muster with purists who look for one hundred percent accuracy in their story telling to get beyond that one need only put aside the history book and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction i know i know that's hard to do when you consider custer's last stand at the little big horn and it's prominence in the history of post civil war america so i guess there's an unresolved quandary with the picture no matter how you look at it<br /><br />there's a lot to take in here though for the picture's two hour plus run time custer's arrival at west point is probably the first head scratcher riding up as he does in full military regalia the practical joke by sharp (arthur kennedy) putting him up in the major's headquarters probably should have gotten them both in trouble<br /><br />ironically a lot of scenes in this military film play for comedy as in custer's first meeting with libby bacon and subsequent encounters that include tea reader callie (hattie mcdaniel) i hadn't noticed it before in other films but mcdaniel reminded me an awful lot of another favorite character actor of mine from the forties mantan moreland so much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been moreland hamming it up in a dress with that in mind the owl scene was a hoot too<br /><br />as for flynn it's interesting to note that a year earlier he portrayed jeb stuart opposite ronald reagan's depiction of general custer in ""santa fe trail"" both vying for the attention of none other than olivia de havilland in that film reagan put none of the arrogance and flamboyance into the character of custer that history remembers while in flynn's portrayal here it's more than evident but it doesn't come close to that of richard mulligan's take on the military hero in 1970's ""little big man"" let's just say that one was a bit over the top<br /><br />the better take away the picture had for me was the manner in which custer persevered to maintain his good name and not gamble it away on a risky business venture that and his loyalty to the men he led in battle along with the discipline he developed over the course of the story most poignant was that final confrontation with arch rival sharp just before riding into the little big horn in which he declared that hell or glory was entirely dependent on one's point of view earlier a similar remark might have given us the best insight of all into custer's character when he stated -
