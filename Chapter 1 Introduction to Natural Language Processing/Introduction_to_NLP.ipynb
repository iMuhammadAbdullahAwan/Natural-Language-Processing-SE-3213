    "## **Chapter 1: Introduction to Natural Language Processing**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Goal*: Understand what NLP is, its real-world applications, and how to set up a coding environment to start processing text, laying the groundwork for NLP research.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Theory (3 hours)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **What is NLP?**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to understand, process, and generate human language (e.g., English, Spanish).\n",
    "  - Example: When you ask Siri, “What’s the weather?” it understands your question and responds.\n",
    "- **Why It Matters**: NLP powers tools like chatbots, translation apps, and search engines, making human-computer interaction seamless.\n",
    "- **Relevance to R&D**: NLP research drives innovations like smarter chatbots (e.g., Grok), better translation systems, and bias detection in text.\n",
    "- **Learning Tip**: Think of NLP as teaching a computer to “read” and “write” like a human, but using math and code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **History of NLP**\n",
    "- **1950s–1980s**: Rule-based systems (e.g., hand-crafted grammar rules to parse sentences). Slow and limited.\n",
    "- **1990s–2000s**: Statistical models (e.g., using probabilities to predict words). More flexible but data-hungry.\n",
    "- **2010s–Present**: Neural networks (e.g., transformers like BERT, GPT). Highly accurate, powering modern NLP.\n",
    "- **R&D Insight**: Transformers, introduced in 2017, revolutionized NLP. You’ll explore them in advanced chapters and research papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Applications**\n",
    "- **Chatbots**: Customer service bots (e.g., answering FAQs on websites).\n",
    "- **Machine Translation**: Google Translate converting English to Hindi.\n",
    "- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzing X posts to detect positive/negative emotions.\n",
    "- **Speech Recognition**: Transcribing podcasts or voice commands.\n",
    "- **Question Answering**: Systems like me (Grok) answering your queries.\n",
    "- **Text Summarization**: Summarizing news articles or research papers.\n",
    "- **R&D Example**: Developing a chatbot for mental health support or detecting fake news on X.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Components of NLP**\n",
    "- **Syntax**: Analyzing sentence structure (e.g., “The cat runs” → subject, verb).\n",
    "  - Example: Identifying nouns and verbs in “I love NLP.”\n",
    "- **Semantics**: Understanding meaning (e.g., “bank” as a financial institution vs. riverbank).\n",
    "  - Example: Knowing “apple” refers to a fruit or company based on context.\n",
    "- **Pragmatics**: Interpreting context (e.g., detecting sarcasm in “Great job!” when it’s negative).\n",
    "  - Example: Understanding “It’s cold in here” might mean “Close the window.”\n",
    "- **Key Insight**: NLP combines these to mimic human language understanding, critical for research in areas like dialogue systems.\n",
