0,"Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, has said its December sales are expected to be better than previously forecast because of strong post-Christmas sales.""The continuing economic expansion, combined with job growth, has consumers ending this year on a high note,"" said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's consumer research centre.The feel-good factor among US consumers rose in December for the first time since July according to new data.Consumers' confidence in the state of the US economy is at its highest for five months and they are optimistic about 2005, an influential survey says.US retailers have reported strong sales over the past 10 days after a slow start to the crucial festive season.","['job', 'board', 'survey', 'december', 'conference', 'economic', 'consumer', 'sales', 'confidence', 'consumers']"
1,"Brute force budget cuts or spending caps would ill-serve the nation's elderly and indigent.News coverage of the Bush budget will be dominated by debates about spending cuts, but the fact is these will be large cuts in small programs.Without major changes in current policies and political prejudices, the federal budget simply cannot hold together.The budget proposals laid out by the administration of US President George W Bush are highly controversial.Federal revenues are at 1950s levels, while spending remains where it has been in recent decades - much higher.Indeed, if Congress were rash enough to balance the budget in this way, there would hardly be any such spending left.The US Government cannot finance its operations without heavy borrowing from the central banks of Japan and China, among other nations.One thing is certain - destroying the budget in order to save it is not going to equip the US economy and government for the challenges of this new century.This upward trend will force increased borrowing by the federal government, putting upward pressure on interest rates faced by consumers and business.Reducing domestic spending, or eliminating ""waste, fraud and abuse"" is toothless because this slice of the budget is too small to solve the problem.The biggest spending growth areas are defence (including homeland security), and health care for the elderly and the poor.Savings in health care spending that do not come at the expense of health can only be achieved with wholesale reform of the entire system, public and private.Even now, a growing share of US borrowing is from abroad.US politicians and citizens of all political persuasions are in for a dose of shock therapy.Under direct threat will be the federal government's ability to make good on its debts to the Social Security Trust Fund.By definition, the deficit means too little revenue and too much spending - but this neutral description doesn't adequately capture the current situation.The trigger for the coming shock will be rising federal debt, which will grow in 10 years, by conservative estimates, to more than half the nation's total annual output.From the standpoint of the big fiscal trends, the cuts are gratuitous and the big budget train wreck is yet to come.The US population is aging, and the nation does face genuine threats in the world.There will be no need for constitutional amendments to balance the budget.","['reform', 'tax', 'revenue', 'bush', 'health', 'small', 'federal', 'cuts', 'spending', 'budget']"
2,"Trouble-hit Mitsubishi Motors is in talks with French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen about a possible alliance.On Tuesday Mitsubishi, the only major Japanese car firm in the red, confirmed earlier reports of negotiations.But a spokesman refused to comment on speculation that Mitsubishi could end up building cars for PSA and perhaps its Japanese rival Nissan.Mitsubishi has been hit by a recall scandal and the withdrawal of support from shareholder DaimlerChrysler.","['scandal', 'carmaker', 'french', 'vehicles', 'sales', 'hit', 'talks', 'japanese', 'shareholder', 'mitsubishi']"
3,"Typically it takes about three years from when a decision is taken before a new model hits the streets, Mr Panke said, implying that a BMW crossover could be on the market by 2008.""We have decided that BMW will enter the [crossover] segment,"" he said in the clearest indication yet about the car maker's intentions.""We have decided that the BMW brand will enter the segment,"" he said.While in the US drivers tend to prefer sports utility vehicles (SUVs), such as the BMW X5 and its sibling X3, in Europe demand for crossover vehicles is likely to be considerable, Mr Panke said.""There's a growing market here,"" he said.Speaking at a BMW event ahead of the Geneva motor show, Helmut Panke predicted demand for such crossover vehicles would soar in Europe.","['demand', 'new', 'europe', 'decision', 'mr', 'said', 'market', 'car', 'enter', 'vehicles']"
4,"More than 2,000 business and political leaders from around the globe are arriving in the Swiss mountain resort Davos for the annual World Economic Forum (WEF).But much of the media focus will be on the political leaders coming to Davos, not least because the agenda of this year's forum seems to lack an overarching theme.The Brazilian city of Porto Alegre will host the rival World Social Forum, timed to run in parallel with the WEF's ritzier event in Davos.Mr Gates' company, software giant Microsoft, also hopes to use Davos to shore up its defences against open source software like Linux, which threaten Microsoft's near monopoly on computer desktops.However, many of the issues discussed in Porto Alegre are Davos talking points as well.UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and South African President Thabo Mbeki are among the more than 20 government leaders and heads of state leaders attending the meeting.Davos fans still hark back to 1994, when talks between Yassir Arafat and Mr Peres came close to a peace deal.Microsoft founder Bill Gates, the world's richest man and a regular at Davos, will focus on campaigning for good causes, though business interests will not be wholly absent either.The US government may still make a conciliatory gesture, just as happened a year ago when Vice President Dick Cheney made a surprise appearance in Davos.Davos itself is in deep frost.Mr Gates is said to be trying to arrange a meeting with Brazil's President Lula da Silva.Having already donated billions of dollars to the fight against Aids and Malaria, Mr Gates will call on world leaders to support a global vaccination campaign to protect children in developing countries from easily preventable diseases.At Davos, global problem solving and networking are never far apart.","['global', 'swiss', 'government', 'issues', 'world', 'political', 'mr', 'president', 'leaders', 'davos']"
5,"Madagascar has completed the replacement of its Malagasy franc with a new currency, the ariary.The ariary was the name of a pre-colonial currency in the Indian Ocean island state.The phasing out of the franc, begun in July 2003, was intended to distance the country from its past under French colonial rule and address the problem of the large amount of counterfeit francs in circulation.From Monday, all prices and contracts will have to be quoted in the ariary, which was trading at 1,893 to the US dollar.","['problem', 'pre', 'longer', 'rule', 'completed', 'distance', 'contracts', 'quoted', 'french', 'currency']"
6,"The US stock market regulator is investigating troubled insurance broker Marsh & McLennan's shareholder transactions, the firm has said.Marsh has said it is co-operating fully with the SEC investigation.Marsh is also the focus of an inquiry the New York attorney-general into whether insurers rigged the market.Since that inquiry was launched in October, Marsh has replaced its chief executive and held a boardroom shake-out to meet criticism by lessening the number of company executives on the board.Prosecutors allege that Marsh - the world's biggest insurance broker - and other US insurance firms may have fixed bids for corporate cover.The uncertainty unleashed by the scandal has prompted three credit rating agencies - Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch - to downgrade Marsh in recent weeks.","['investigation', 'scandal', 'troubled', 'insurers', 'sec', 'inquiry', 'transactions', 'insurance', 'spitzer', 'marsh']"
7,"Shares in India's largest power producer, National Thermal Power Corp (NTPC) have risen 13% on their stock market debut.""Power needs in India are set to rise and NTPC will benefit from that.""NTPC has said it will use the money from the share sale to feed the growing needs of the country's energy-starved economy.Analysts say the success of the NTPC flotation would encourage the government to reduce stakes in more power companies.","['stock', 'government', 'offer', 'shares', 'needs', 'largest', 'producer', 'share', 'india', 'power']"
8,"Despite its string of bad luck, he pointed out, Aurora is just one vessel in a large Carnival fleet, the UK's P&O Princess group having been merged into the much larger US firm in 2003.And with Carnival remaining the market leader, it looks set to keep selling the tickets - no matter what happens to the ill-fated Aurora in the future.Similarly, analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business to be limited.After all, the Aurora incident may be big news in the UK - but for Carnival customers elsewhere it's unlikely to make too much of a splash.And generally speaking, Carnival has a reputation for keeping its ships pretty much on schedule.And its owner, P&O Cruises - now part of the huge US Carnival Corporation - was looking at a significant slice chopped off this year's profits and a potential PR fiasco.In the wake of P&O Princess's takeover by Carnival, the business is now to a great extent a duopoly.""The Aurora issue had been an ongoing one for some time,"" says Deutsche Bank's Simon Champion.""Carnival has an incredibly strong track record,"" Mr Champion.In other words, if you do want a cruise, your options are limited.","['industry', 'stock', 'just', 'future', 'impact', 'market', 'bad', 'citigroup', 'limited', 'carnival']"
9,"The National Statistic Institute (INSEE) added that consumer spending in January rose 3.8% on a year-on-year basis.The INSEE also said that French consumer prices fell 0.6% in January, but were up 1.6% on an annual basis.Despite the general increase in spending in January, French households bought fewer cars in January.French consumers increased their spending by 1.5% in January, a figure which bodes well for the country's economic growth, figures revealed.According to the INSEE, car sales fell 2.8% in January, following a fall of 0.6% in December.","['sales', 'increase', 'rose', '06', 'confidence', 'basis', 'spending', 'january', 'french', 'consumer']"
10,"US oil prices have fallen by 6%, driven down by forecasts of a mild winter in the densely populated northeast.Statistics released last week showed that stockpiles of oil products in the US had risen, an indication that severe supply disruptions may not arise this winter, barring any serious incident.Oil prices have broken records in 2004, topping $50 a barrel at one point, driven up by a welter of worries about unrest in Iraq and Saudi Arabia, rising demand and supply bottlenecks.Light crude oil futures fell $2.86 to $41.32 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex), and have now lost $4 in five days.Nonetheless, US crude is still 30% more expensive than at the beginning of 2004, boosted by growing demand and bottlenecks at refineries.","['saudi', 'prices', 'demand', 'exchange', 'driven', 'supply', 'crude', 'barrel', 'winter', 'oil']"
11,"A US firm has said it is in final negotiations with luxury goods group LVMH to buy the loss-making Christian Lacroix haute-couture house.But one of the three brothers behind the Falic Group said the firm had also held talks with the designer Christian Lacroix, and wished to retain him.Privately-held Falic Group bought two cosmetics brands, Hard Candy and Urban Decay, from LVMH in early 2003.Paris-based LVMH has been selling non-core businesses and focusing on its most profitable labels including Moet & Chandon champagne and Louis Vuitton.","['comment', 'final', 'brand', 'stores', 'profitable', 'bids', 'increase', 'firm', 'group', 'held']"
12,"Meanwhile, drugs group Eli Lilly is planning a campaign against ""false"" claims about its product Prozac.Meanwhile Eli Lilly is launching a series of adverts in a dozen major newspapers, to present what is says are the true facts about its anti-depressant drug Prozac.Wal-Mart kicked off the battle with adverts in newspapers like the Wall Street Journal, using an open letter from company president Lee Scott saying it was time for the public to hear the ""unfiltered truth"".Eli Lilly's chief medical officer Alan Breier said that the article was ""false and misleading"" as the documents it referred to were actually created by officials at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and presented to an FDA meeting in 1991.""I think they are going to have a tough time suddenly overcoming the perceptions of some people,"" said Larry Bevington, chairman of Save Our Community - a group fighting to prevent Wal-Mart opening a store in Rosemead, California.The world's biggest retailer Wal-Mart took out more than 100 full page adverts in national newspapers.Wal-Mart's average pay is almost twice the national minimum wage of $5.15 (Â£3.90) an hour, while employees are offered health and life insurance, company stock and a retirement plan, the adverts say.""It was simply wrong to suggest that information on Prozac was missing, or that important research data on the benefits and possible side effects of the drug were not available to doctors and regulators,"" the letter added.","['open', 'employees', 'allegations', 'missing', 'good', 'group', 'benefits', 'drug', 'mart', 'wal']"
13,"While pinpointing several areas in which there are difficulties in the bilateral and multilateral work with Russia, the US said the meeting was ""much more efficient than we've seen for some time"".Mr Johannesson also said progress ""on the bilateral market access side is accelerating"".His comments came as President George W Bush said the US backed Russian entry.But he said for Russia to make progress the government must ""renew a commitment to democracy and the rule of law"".Talks on Russia's proposed membership of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) have been ""making good progress"" say those behind the negotiations.Some WTO members also dislike Russia's energy price subsidies, which competitors say give Russian businesses an unfair advantage.","['talks', 'members', 'russian', 'kong', 'comments', 'hong', 'membership', 'progress', 'russia', 'wto']"
14,"Swiss drugmaker Novartis has announced 5.65bn euros ($7.4bn; Â£3.9bn) of purchases to make its Sandoz unit the world's biggest generic drug producer.Novartis said that it would be able to make cost savings of about $200m a year following the acquisitions.Novartis said that it would merge a number of departments, adding that there may be job cuts.The deal will see Novartis' Sandoz business overtake Israel's Teva Pharmaceuticals as the world's biggest maker of generics.Novartis, which last month forecast record sales for 2005, said it had bought all of Germany's Hexal.Novartis' shares rose 1% to 57.85 Swiss francs in early trading.","['world', 'shares', 'drug', 'biggest', 'deal', 'sales', 'make', 'cost', 'producer', 'swiss']"
15,"EBay now forecasts 2005 revenue of $4.2bn to $4.35bn and earnings excluding items of $1.48 to $1.52 per share.Analysts had previously estimated that eBay would achieve 2005 revenues of $4.37bn and earnings of $1.62 per share, excluding items.For 2004 as a whole, eBay earned $778.2m on sales of $3.27bn.Excluding special items, eBay's profit was 33 cents a share, but analysts had expected 34 cents.""I think Wall Street has gotten a bit ahead of eBay this quarter and for the 2005 year.""","['fell', 'profit', 'earnings', 'revenue', 'net', 'share', '2005', 'street', 'wall', 'ebay']"

17,"Shares in US phone company MCI have risen on speculation that it is in takeover talks.The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Qwest has bid $6.3bn (Â£3.4bn) for MCI.Shares in MCI, which changed its name from Worldcom when it emerged from bankruptcy, were up 2.4% at $20.15.Competition has intensified and fixed-line phone providers such as MCI and AT&T have seen themselves overtaken by rivals.Buying MCI would give Qwest, a local phone service provider, access to MCI's global network and business-based subscribers.The largest US telephone company Verizon has previously held preliminary merger discussions with MCI, Reuters quoted sources as saying.Other firms have also expressed an interest in MCI, the second-largest US long-distance phone firm, and may now table rival bids, analysts said.","['bankruptcy', 'takeover', 'rival', 'shares', 'merger', 'bids', 'worldcom', 'qwest', 'phone', 'mci']"
18,"Separately, the SEC said it had reached a $140m deal - equally split between penalties and compensation - in its probe into Columbia Management Advisors (CAM) and Columbia Funds Distributor (CFD) and three ex-Columbia executives.The SEC also said it had brought fraud charges against two ex-senior executives of Columbia Distributor.Columbia Distributor was part of FleetBoston, bought by BOA last year.Three other ex-Columbia executives agreed settlements with the SEC.The SEC has set itself the task of stamping out the mutual funds' use of market-timing, a form of quick-fire, short-term share trading that harms the interests of small investors, with whom mutual funds are particularly popular.The SEC unveiled two separate settlements, one covering BOA's direct subsidiaries, and another for businesses that were part of FleetBoston at the time.The SEC agreed a deal totalling $375m with Banc of America Capital Management, BACAP Distributors and Banc of America Securities.In both cases, it said there had been secret deals to engage in market timing in mutual fund shares.","['bank', 'gains', 'paid', 'settlement', 'agreed', 'america', 'executives', 'ex', 'funds', 'sec']"

26,"Other countries also are reported to have pledged cash, while the US State Department said it was examining what aid was needed in the region.Other agencies, such as the Asian Development Bank, have said that it is too early to comment on the amount of aid needed.Growth has been rapid in southeast Asia, with the World Tourism Organisation figures showing a 45% increase in tourist revenues in the region during the first 10 months of 2004.""I should assume, however, that the overall dimension of insured damages is below the storm damages of the US,"" he said.The European Union has said it will deliver 3m euros (Â£2.1m; $4.1m) of aid, according to the Wall Street Journal.Early estimates from the World Bank put the amount of aid needed at about $5bn (Â£2.6bn), similar to the cash offered Central America after Hurricane Mitch.Tourism is a vital part of the economies of the stricken countries, providing jobs for 19 million people in the south east Asian region, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC).""India continues to post excellent results thanks to increased promotion and product development, but also to the upsurge in business travel driven by the rapid economic development of the country,"" the WTO said.The EU's Humanitarian Aid Commissioner, Louis Michel, was quoted as saying that it was key to bring aid ""in those vital hours and days immediately after the disaster"".Governments, aid agencies, insurers and travel firms are among those counting the cost of the massive earthquake and waves that hammered southern Asia.Mitch killed about 10,000 people and caused damage of about $10bn in 1998.December and January are two of the busiest months for the travel in southern Asia and the damage will be even more keenly felt as the industry was only just beginning to emerge from a post 9/11 slump.Only Sri Lanka and Bangladesh currently receive IMF support, while Indonesia, the quake's epicentre, has recently graduated from IMF assistance.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has promised rapid action to help the governments of the stricken countries cope.Tourism also brings in much needed foreign currency.""Arrivals to other destinations such as...

27,"Minutes of the December meeting which pushed rates up to 2.25% showed that policy-makers at the Fed are worried about accelerating inflation.The key Fed funds rate has risen 1.25 percentage points during 2004 from the 46-year low of 1% reached not long after the 9/11 attacks in 2001.The US looks set for a continued boost to interest rates in 2005, according to the Federal Reserve.The odds now favour a further boost to rates at the next meeting in early February, economists said.This, too, is being taken in some quarters as a sign of aggressive moves on interest rates to come.The clear signal pushed the dollar up to $1.3270 to the euro by 0400 GMT on Wednesday, but depressed US shares.","['wednesday', 'federal', 'points', 'minutes', 'meeting', 'dollar', 'pushed', 'markets', 'rates', 'fed']"
28,"""The task is not simply to double GDP; instead it is to use GDP to qualitatively improve people's lives,"" Mr Gref told Kommersant.Economy minister German Gref told the Kommersant newspaper that direct state involvement in oil was ""unjustified"".And he warned that using back taxes to deal with firms like Yukos - a technique now being applied by the Kremlin to several other firms - was a mistake.The privatisation of companies such as Yukos in the 1990s had been badly handled, he said.Mr Gref also poured cold water on President Putin's promises of doubled economic growth within a decade.His comments follow the sale of much of oil giant Yukos to cover back taxes - a deal which effectively took most of the firm's assets into public ownership.The assault on Yukos' assets has been widely blamed for a slowdown in economic growth in recent months.Yuganskneftegaz, the unit which produced 60% of Yukos' output, had been seized and sold in December for less than $10bn to a previously unknown firm called Baikal.Mr Gref, a well-known opponent of nationalisation in competitive parts of the market, was keen to distance himself from Mr Iliaronov's comments.","['comments', 'putin', 'economic', 'sale', 'companies', 'baikal', 'state', 'gdp', 'taxes', 'yukos']"
29,"UK-based bank Standard Chartered said it would spend $3.3bn (Â£1.8bn) to buy one of South Korea's main retail banks.The move, a year after Citigroup beat Standard Chartered to buy Koram bank, would be the South Korean financial sector's biggest foreign takeover.Standard Chartered said KFB was a ""well-managed, conservatively run bank with a highly skilled workforce"" and represented a ""significant acquisition in a growth market"".Some analysts also queried whether Standard Chartered had overpaid for KFB.Standard Chartered said acquiring Korea First Bank (KFB) fulfilled a strategic objective of building a bigger presence in Asia's third largest economy.Standard Chartered expects about 16% of future group revenue to come from KFB.This time around, Standard Chartered is thought to have beaten HSBC to the deal.KFB is South Korea's seventh largest bank, with 3 million retail customers, 6% of the country's banking market and an extensive branch network.Standard Chartered said it was buying 100% of KFB, an agreement that would bring an end to the bank's complex dual ownership.HSBC will now have to wait for the next South Korean bank in line to be sold off - thought likely to be Korea Exchange Bank, also currently in the hands of a US group.Standard Chartered sees ""the opportunity to create value by the introduction of more sophisticated banking products"".The deal, which requires regulatory approval, is expected to be completed by April 2005 and to be earnings accretive in 2006, Standard Chartered said.Standard Chartered has its headquarters in London but does two thirds of its business in Asia, and much of the rest in Africa.","['financial', 'retail', 'london', 'banking', 'korean', 'bank', 'korea', 'south', 'standard', 'chartered']"
